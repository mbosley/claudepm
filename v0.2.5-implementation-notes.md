# v0.2.5 Implementation Notes

Based on Gemini's final review, here are the minor refinements to consider during implementation:

## 1. Add --dry-run to adopt command
```bash
claudepm adopt --dry-run
# Shows what would be created without writing files
# Builds user trust by previewing actions
```

## 2. Enhance task command for status changes
```bash
# Instead of manual sed commands:
claudepm task done <UUID>
claudepm task block <UUID> "waiting for API keys"

# These wrap robust sed/awk operations
```

## 3. Handle date filtering robustly in get-context.sh
```bash
# For --days filtering, use awk for date parsing
# More robust than simple grep for date ranges
```

## 4. Auto-update .gitignore
```bash
# In adopt/init commands:
if ! grep -q "^.claudepm$" .gitignore 2>/dev/null; then
    echo ".claudepm" >> .gitignore
    echo "Added .claudepm to .gitignore"
fi
```

## 5. Document single-user assumption
Add to README: "claudepm commands are designed for interactive, single-user execution"

## Key Validation Points from Gemini

✅ "Philosophical Integrity" - Every decision reinforces core philosophy
✅ "NOTES.md inclusion is a masterstroke"  
✅ "Non-destructive upgrade using markers is excellent"
✅ "Task Agent workflow demonstrates power without complexity"
✅ "Slash commands in ~/.claudepm/commands is the correct decision"
✅ "Document is a model of clarity and thoughtful design"

## Final Verdict
"The plan is comprehensive and ready for implementation. Proceed with confidence."
