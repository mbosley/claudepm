description: Use Gemini 2.5 Pro to architect a complex feature before implementation
---

**Purpose**: Use Gemini 2.5 Pro's 1M token context window to analyze the entire codebase and create a comprehensive architectural plan for complex features.

**Transparency**: This command uses two AI models:
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** - Analyzes your codebase and creates the architectural plan
- **Claude (me)** - Reviews Gemini's plan and implements the feature

You'll see exactly what each AI contributes, with clear attribution.

**When to use**: For features that touch multiple files, require design decisions, or benefit from holistic codebase understanding.

**Process**:
1. Describe the feature you want to implement
2. Gemini analyzes your entire codebase (may take 15-30 seconds)
3. Gemini's complete architectural plan is displayed
4. You review and approve the plan
5. Claude implements following the architecture

**What you'll get**:
- Comprehensive technical design
- File-by-file implementation plan
- Integration points identified
- Edge cases considered
- Testing strategy outlined

To use this command, provide a clear description of the feature you want to implement.

<mcp__llm-tools__analyze_with_gemini>
<files>**/*.md</files>
<files>**/*.sh</files>
<files>**/*.json</files>
<files>**/*.txt</files>
<files>!**/.git/**</files>
<files>!**/node_modules/**</files>
<prompt>
You are an expert software architect. Analyze this codebase and create a comprehensive architectural plan for the following feature:

{{user_input}}

Provide:
1. **Technical Design**: Core architecture decisions and patterns
2. **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step with specific files to modify/create
3. **Integration Points**: How this fits with existing code
4. **Edge Cases**: Potential issues and how to handle them
5. **Testing Strategy**: How to verify the implementation works
6. **Migration Path**: If this changes existing functionality

Be specific about file paths, function names, and code structure. Consider the project's existing patterns and philosophy.

IMPORTANT: Return your COMPLETE analysis. Do not truncate or summarize.

# üîß Claude's Implementation Strategy

Now that Gemini has provided the architectural blueprint, here's how I (Claude) will implement this feature:

1. **Review the architecture** - Does the plan align with your vision?
2. **Identify risks** - Are there any concerns with the proposed approach?
3. **Adjust if needed** - We can refine the plan before starting
4. **Implement systematically** - Follow the plan step-by-step

**Next steps**:
- Type "proceed" to start implementation following this architecture
- Type "adjust" to modify the plan
- Type "cancel" to abandon this feature
- Consider using `/dispatch-task` to create a Task Agent for isolated implementation

This collaborative approach leverages Gemini's analytical capabilities for architecture and Claude's implementation skills for execution.
