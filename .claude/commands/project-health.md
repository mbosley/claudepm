Analyze project health and identify which need attention

Check all projects for blockers, overdue items, and stale work to prioritize interventions.

## Instructions:
1. For each project directory, check:
   - Last activity date (from CLAUDE_LOG.md)
   - Number of blocked items (in ROADMAP.md)
   - Git status (uncommitted changes)
   - Overdue deadlines (search for [DUE: dates] that have passed)
   - Days since last commit

2. Generate a health report:

```
