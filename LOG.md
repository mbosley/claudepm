### 2025-07-03 20:53 - Completed v0.2.5.1 Claude-First Protocol
Did:
- IMPLEMENTED: claudepm context command for session startup
- IMPLEMENTED: claudepm log command with --next flag
- IMPLEMENTED: claudepm next command for task prioritization
- REWROTE: Templates to teach claudepm as protocol
- FIXED: Delimiter parsing bug (:: â†’ | internally)
- FIXED: Date resolution in initial LOG.md entries
- FIXED: Count parsing whitespace issues
Next: Test v0.2.5.1 with real Claude sessions
Notes: claudepm is now a protocol for AI agents, not just a tool. The protocol layers ensure consistency while allowing flexibility.

- Added tags with #hashtag format for searchability
- Added git commit tracking with --commit flag
- Added people mentions with @-tags via --with flag
- Added time tracking with --time flag
- Added PR/issue references with --pr flag
- Added error tracking with --error flag

### 2025-07-03 21:27 - Simplified claudepm protocol
Did:
- Removed prescriptive log options (--did, --tag, --time, etc.)
- Reduced log_work from 183 to 37 lines
- Updated templates to show flexible formatting
- Embraced 'structure + freedom' philosophy

Key insight: The protocol should provide minimal structure (timestamp, title) and let Claude decide how to format the content based on context.

Next: Split utils.sh into modules for v0.3
