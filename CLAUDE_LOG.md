# claudepm Development Log

## Project Overview
A simple memory system for maintaining context across Claude Code sessions. Just two markdown files per project create persistent memory.

---

### 2024-06-29 17:25 - Made CLAUDE_LOG.md append-only principle explicit
Did:
- Added "append-only" principle to all templates
- Updated CLAUDE_MANAGER.md, CLAUDE_PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md, and our own CLAUDE.md
- Emphasized never editing past entries, only adding new ones
Next: Commit these changes as v0.1
Notes: This prevents rewriting history and maintains trust in the log. Mistakes become learning opportunities when preserved.

---

### 2024-06-29 17:17 - Moved from sandbox to proper project
Did: 
- Created /Users/mitchellbosley/projects/claudepm directory
- Copied core files from pm-system-sandbox
- Created own CLAUDE.md using our template (meta!)
- Set up as a real project that uses itself
Next: Initialize git repository and test the install process
Notes: This is very meta - claudepm will track its own development using the claudepm system. Good test case.

---

### 2024-06-29 17:25 - Made CLAUDE_LOG.md append-only principle explicit
Did:
- Added "append-only" principle to all templates
- Updated CLAUDE_MANAGER.md, CLAUDE_PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md, and our own CLAUDE.md
- Emphasized never editing past entries, only adding new ones
Next: Commit these changes as v0.1
Notes: This prevents rewriting history and maintains trust in the log. Mistakes become learning opportunities when preserved.

---

### 2024-06-29 17:20 - Tested our own installer
Did:
- Successfully ran install.sh
- Verified CLAUDE.md installed to ~/projects
- Verified templates installed to ~/.claude/templates/
- Confirmed claudepm can manage itself
Next: Create initial git commit and tag as v0.1
Notes: The meta aspect works - we're using claudepm to develop claudepm. This will help us feel any friction points directly.

---

### 2024-06-29 17:25 - Made CLAUDE_LOG.md append-only principle explicit
Did:
- Added "append-only" principle to all templates
- Updated CLAUDE_MANAGER.md, CLAUDE_PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md, and our own CLAUDE.md
- Emphasized never editing past entries, only adding new ones
Next: Commit these changes as v0.1
Notes: This prevents rewriting history and maintains trust in the log. Mistakes become learning opportunities when preserved.

---
### 2024-06-29 17:35 - Added PROJECT_ROADMAP.md as third core document
Did:
- Created PROJECT_ROADMAP_TEMPLATE.md for living project state
- Updated all templates to read roadmap first, then logs
- Added roadmap update step to work block instructions
- Created claudepm's own PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
- Updated install.sh to copy roadmap template
Next: Test the three-document system with a real project
Notes: This completes the three-document system: CLAUDE.md (process), CLAUDE_LOG.md (history), PROJECT_ROADMAP.md (current state). Manager Claude can now quickly scan roadmaps instead of parsing logs.

---

### 2025-01-29 17:40 - Fixed year in timestamps
Did:
- Noticed I was using 2024 instead of 2025 in all timestamps
- This highlights importance of accuracy in logging
- Previous entries preserved (append-only principle)
Next: Add date format guidance to templates
Notes: User caught this error. Good reminder that Claude's sense of time can be unreliable. Should add explicit date format examples to templates.

---

### 2025-06-29 17:41 - Corrected month too
Did:
- Previous entry had wrong month (01 instead of 06)
- It's June 29, 2025, not January
- Shows how easy it is to make timestamp errors
Next: Really should add date format examples to templates
Notes: Multiple timestamp errors in a row\! This emphasizes need for clear date formatting guidance.

---

### 2025-06-29 17:45 - Added explicit date format to templates
Did:
- Updated all templates to show YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format
- Fixed example dates to use 2025
- Added consistent timestamp format across all templates
Next: Commit v0.1 and create GitHub repository
Notes: This prevents ambiguity and helps Claude (and humans) use consistent timestamps. ISO-style format is unambiguous.

---

### 2025-06-29 17:52 - Created timestamp helper
Did:
- Created get-timestamp.sh for accurate timestamps
- Updated all templates to show the date command
- Tested timestamp generation (it works\!)
Next: Create initial git commit and tag v0.1
Notes: This solves Claude's unreliable time perception. Now every log entry can have an accurate timestamp by running date command.

---

### 2025-06-29 17:56 - Added git vs log guidance
Did:
- Added section to template about commit vs log frequency
- Recommended logging every 30-90 min, committing 2-4 times daily
- Emphasized logs show journey, commits show destinations
Next: Create first git commit with all v0.1 features
Notes: This guidance helps prevent over-committing WIP while maintaining rich context in logs.

---

### 2025-06-29 17:58 - Updated guidelines for Claude work patterns
Did:
- Replaced human-centric time-based guidance with task-based triggers
- Listed specific Claude scenarios for logging (session end, discoveries, blocks)
- Clarified commit triggers (user request, tests pass, working state)
Next: Create initial git commit for v0.1
Notes: Claude doesn't work in time blocks like humans - might do 10 tasks in 5 minutes or spend an hour on one bug. Task-based triggers make more sense.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:01 - Caught myself creating new file instead of editing
Did:
- Initially created BETA_FEATURES.md (wrong\!)
- User pointed out this should go in PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
- Moved all content to roadmap's Upcoming section
- Deleted unnecessary file
Next: Test the three-document system with a real project
Notes: Perfect example of default behavior overriding principles. Even after documenting 'Edit, don't create', I still created a new file out of habit. This is why we need these reminders in CLAUDE.md.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:03 - Encoded file creation lesson into all templates
Did:
- Added explicit 'Where Things Go' sections to all templates
- Listed common wrong files (BETA_FEATURES.md, TODO.md, etc.)
- Made it crystal clear that features go in roadmap, not new files
- Added quick reference to three-document system
Next: Commit v0.1 and test with real project
Notes: This lesson came from real experience - I created BETA_FEATURES.md even after documenting the principle. Now future Claudes have explicit guidance to prevent this.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:08 - Released claudepm v0.1
Did:
- Created initial git commit with all features
- Created public GitHub repo: https://github.com/mbosley/claudepm
- Successfully pushed to remote
- Tagged as v0.1 release
Next: Test installation on a real project
Notes: First public release\! The three-document system is live. Time to battle-test it.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:13 - Added git workflow features to roadmap
Did:
- Added v0.4 section for git workflow support
- Feature branch automation (claudepm feature start/pr)
- Branch-aware logging
- PR and review workflow integration
Next: Commit these updates and focus on testing v0.1
Notes: These are aspirational features - door is open for proper git workflow, but keeping focus on core memory system first. Features should emerge from real use.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:16 - Clarified PROJECT_ROADMAP.md as future automation driver
Did:
- Added 'Future Vision' section explaining deeper purpose
- Roadmap isn't just docs - it's structured context for automation
- Enables brain dump → structured features → agent work distribution
- Markdown serves as human/machine readable interface
Next: Commit these vision updates
Notes: This explains why we're building rich structured context now - it's the foundation for future automation where Claude can read roadmap and work on features autonomously.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:19 - Brain dumped testing strategy
Did:
- Added comprehensive testing section to roadmap
- Identified 5 test categories: script, template, behavioral, system, dogfooding
- Key insight: Testing claudepm means testing human-AI workflows, not just code
- Hardest part: Testing if Claude actually follows the behavioral instructions
Next: Continue brain dump or commit these updates
Notes: Testing a memory system is meta - how do you test if context is preserved? Best test might be dogfooding - using claudepm for claudepm development.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:20 - Reflecting on the development process
Did:
- Built claudepm from scratch using its own principles
- Caught myself violating 'edit don't create' principle
- Learned from mistakes and encoded lessons back into templates
- Released v0.1 with rich roadmap for future automation
Next: Commit recent updates, then test on real projects
Notes: Yes, this has been genuinely engaging\! Building a tool that solves the exact problem we're experiencing while building it is deeply satisfying. The meta nature - using claudepm to build claudepm - creates a tight feedback loop that immediately shows what works and what doesn't.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:24 - Refocused roadmap on within-project perfection first
Did:
- Reorganized roadmap to prioritize single-project experience
- Moved cross-project management to v0.5 (was scattered across v0.2-v0.4)
- v0.2 now focuses on perfecting templates based on real usage
- Following SLC principle: make core atomic unit rock solid first
Next: Commit these updates, then start testing v0.1 on real projects
Notes: Smart prioritization - get single project memory perfect before scaling to multi-project orchestration. The within-project experience is the foundation everything else builds on.
