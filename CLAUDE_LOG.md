# claudepm Development Log

## Project Overview
A simple memory system for maintaining context across Claude Code sessions. Just two markdown files per project create persistent memory.

---

### 2024-06-29 17:25 - Made CLAUDE_LOG.md append-only principle explicit
Did:
- Added "append-only" principle to all templates
- Updated CLAUDE_MANAGER.md, CLAUDE_PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md, and our own CLAUDE.md
- Emphasized never editing past entries, only adding new ones
Next: Commit these changes as v0.1
Notes: This prevents rewriting history and maintains trust in the log. Mistakes become learning opportunities when preserved.

---

### 2024-06-29 17:17 - Moved from sandbox to proper project
Did: 
- Created /Users/mitchellbosley/projects/claudepm directory
- Copied core files from pm-system-sandbox
- Created own CLAUDE.md using our template (meta!)
- Set up as a real project that uses itself
Next: Initialize git repository and test the install process
Notes: This is very meta - claudepm will track its own development using the claudepm system. Good test case.

---

### 2024-06-29 17:25 - Made CLAUDE_LOG.md append-only principle explicit
Did:
- Added "append-only" principle to all templates
- Updated CLAUDE_MANAGER.md, CLAUDE_PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md, and our own CLAUDE.md
- Emphasized never editing past entries, only adding new ones
Next: Commit these changes as v0.1
Notes: This prevents rewriting history and maintains trust in the log. Mistakes become learning opportunities when preserved.

---

### 2024-06-29 17:20 - Tested our own installer
Did:
- Successfully ran install.sh
- Verified CLAUDE.md installed to ~/projects
- Verified templates installed to ~/.claude/templates/
- Confirmed claudepm can manage itself
Next: Create initial git commit and tag as v0.1
Notes: The meta aspect works - we're using claudepm to develop claudepm. This will help us feel any friction points directly.

---

### 2024-06-29 17:25 - Made CLAUDE_LOG.md append-only principle explicit
Did:
- Added "append-only" principle to all templates
- Updated CLAUDE_MANAGER.md, CLAUDE_PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md, and our own CLAUDE.md
- Emphasized never editing past entries, only adding new ones
Next: Commit these changes as v0.1
Notes: This prevents rewriting history and maintains trust in the log. Mistakes become learning opportunities when preserved.

---
### 2024-06-29 17:35 - Added PROJECT_ROADMAP.md as third core document
Did:
- Created PROJECT_ROADMAP_TEMPLATE.md for living project state
- Updated all templates to read roadmap first, then logs
- Added roadmap update step to work block instructions
- Created claudepm's own PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
- Updated install.sh to copy roadmap template
Next: Test the three-document system with a real project
Notes: This completes the three-document system: CLAUDE.md (process), CLAUDE_LOG.md (history), PROJECT_ROADMAP.md (current state). Manager Claude can now quickly scan roadmaps instead of parsing logs.

---

### 2025-01-29 17:40 - Fixed year in timestamps
Did:
- Noticed I was using 2024 instead of 2025 in all timestamps
- This highlights importance of accuracy in logging
- Previous entries preserved (append-only principle)
Next: Add date format guidance to templates
Notes: User caught this error. Good reminder that Claude's sense of time can be unreliable. Should add explicit date format examples to templates.

---

### 2025-06-29 17:41 - Corrected month too
Did:
- Previous entry had wrong month (01 instead of 06)
- It's June 29, 2025, not January
- Shows how easy it is to make timestamp errors
Next: Really should add date format examples to templates
Notes: Multiple timestamp errors in a row\! This emphasizes need for clear date formatting guidance.

---

### 2025-06-29 17:45 - Added explicit date format to templates
Did:
- Updated all templates to show YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format
- Fixed example dates to use 2025
- Added consistent timestamp format across all templates
Next: Commit v0.1 and create GitHub repository
Notes: This prevents ambiguity and helps Claude (and humans) use consistent timestamps. ISO-style format is unambiguous.

---

### 2025-06-29 17:52 - Created timestamp helper
Did:
- Created get-timestamp.sh for accurate timestamps
- Updated all templates to show the date command
- Tested timestamp generation (it works\!)
Next: Create initial git commit and tag v0.1
Notes: This solves Claude's unreliable time perception. Now every log entry can have an accurate timestamp by running date command.

---

### 2025-06-29 17:56 - Added git vs log guidance
Did:
- Added section to template about commit vs log frequency
- Recommended logging every 30-90 min, committing 2-4 times daily
- Emphasized logs show journey, commits show destinations
Next: Create first git commit with all v0.1 features
Notes: This guidance helps prevent over-committing WIP while maintaining rich context in logs.

---

### 2025-06-29 17:58 - Updated guidelines for Claude work patterns
Did:
- Replaced human-centric time-based guidance with task-based triggers
- Listed specific Claude scenarios for logging (session end, discoveries, blocks)
- Clarified commit triggers (user request, tests pass, working state)
Next: Create initial git commit for v0.1
Notes: Claude doesn't work in time blocks like humans - might do 10 tasks in 5 minutes or spend an hour on one bug. Task-based triggers make more sense.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:01 - Caught myself creating new file instead of editing
Did:
- Initially created BETA_FEATURES.md (wrong\!)
- User pointed out this should go in PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
- Moved all content to roadmap's Upcoming section
- Deleted unnecessary file
Next: Test the three-document system with a real project
Notes: Perfect example of default behavior overriding principles. Even after documenting 'Edit, don't create', I still created a new file out of habit. This is why we need these reminders in CLAUDE.md.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:03 - Encoded file creation lesson into all templates
Did:
- Added explicit 'Where Things Go' sections to all templates
- Listed common wrong files (BETA_FEATURES.md, TODO.md, etc.)
- Made it crystal clear that features go in roadmap, not new files
- Added quick reference to three-document system
Next: Commit v0.1 and test with real project
Notes: This lesson came from real experience - I created BETA_FEATURES.md even after documenting the principle. Now future Claudes have explicit guidance to prevent this.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:08 - Released claudepm v0.1
Did:
- Created initial git commit with all features
- Created public GitHub repo: https://github.com/mbosley/claudepm
- Successfully pushed to remote
- Tagged as v0.1 release
Next: Test installation on a real project
Notes: First public release\! The three-document system is live. Time to battle-test it.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:13 - Added git workflow features to roadmap
Did:
- Added v0.4 section for git workflow support
- Feature branch automation (claudepm feature start/pr)
- Branch-aware logging
- PR and review workflow integration
Next: Commit these updates and focus on testing v0.1
Notes: These are aspirational features - door is open for proper git workflow, but keeping focus on core memory system first. Features should emerge from real use.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:16 - Clarified PROJECT_ROADMAP.md as future automation driver
Did:
- Added 'Future Vision' section explaining deeper purpose
- Roadmap isn't just docs - it's structured context for automation
- Enables brain dump → structured features → agent work distribution
- Markdown serves as human/machine readable interface
Next: Commit these vision updates
Notes: This explains why we're building rich structured context now - it's the foundation for future automation where Claude can read roadmap and work on features autonomously.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:19 - Brain dumped testing strategy
Did:
- Added comprehensive testing section to roadmap
- Identified 5 test categories: script, template, behavioral, system, dogfooding
- Key insight: Testing claudepm means testing human-AI workflows, not just code
- Hardest part: Testing if Claude actually follows the behavioral instructions
Next: Continue brain dump or commit these updates
Notes: Testing a memory system is meta - how do you test if context is preserved? Best test might be dogfooding - using claudepm for claudepm development.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:20 - Reflecting on the development process
Did:
- Built claudepm from scratch using its own principles
- Caught myself violating 'edit don't create' principle
- Learned from mistakes and encoded lessons back into templates
- Released v0.1 with rich roadmap for future automation
Next: Commit recent updates, then test on real projects
Notes: Yes, this has been genuinely engaging\! Building a tool that solves the exact problem we're experiencing while building it is deeply satisfying. The meta nature - using claudepm to build claudepm - creates a tight feedback loop that immediately shows what works and what doesn't.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:24 - Refocused roadmap on within-project perfection first
Did:
- Reorganized roadmap to prioritize single-project experience
- Moved cross-project management to v0.5 (was scattered across v0.2-v0.4)
- v0.2 now focuses on perfecting templates based on real usage
- Following SLC principle: make core atomic unit rock solid first
Next: Commit these updates, then start testing v0.1 on real projects
Notes: Smart prioritization - get single project memory perfect before scaling to multi-project orchestration. The within-project experience is the foundation everything else builds on.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:35 - Added robust installation features to roadmap
Did:
- Added v0.3 for installation & discovery features
- claudepm adopt command for existing projects (with sub-agent analysis)
- claudepm doctor for health checks
- Enhanced installer with configurable root directory
- Renumbered subsequent versions
Next: Commit and push these roadmap additions
Notes: Key insight - adopting existing projects needs intelligence. Sub-agent can analyze repo to pre-populate roadmap with discovered info. Doctor command helps debug installations.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:40 - Added Manager Claude slash commands to roadmap
Did:
- Added slash commands for common manager-level tasks
- /daily-standup - What's on deck across projects
- /daily-review - What got done, what's blocked
- /weekly-review - Week summary and priorities
- /project-health - Which projects need attention
- /start-work - Quick briefing before diving in
Next: Commit these final roadmap additions
Notes: These slash commands turn repetitive intelligence tasks into single commands. Manager Claude becomes your project orchestrator, not just a status checker.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:43 - Added log search as critical feature
Did:
- Promoted log search to v0.7 as critical feature
- Within-project search: "Have I seen this error before?"
- Cross-project search: "How did I solve auth in other projects?"
- Smart search by type (errors, solutions) and sections
- Emphasized this transforms memory → knowledge system
Next: Commit these roadmap updates
Notes: This is THE killer feature - turns accumulated logs into searchable knowledge base. Every problem solved becomes findable. Claude can search before attempting, avoiding repeated mistakes.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:47 - Reordered roadmap for better progression
Did:
- Moved log search to v0.3 (right after perfecting single-project) - critical for value
- Installation/adoption to v0.4 (before multi-project features)
- Cross-project basics to v0.5 (simple status/list commands)
- Advanced search to v0.6 (builds on basic search)
- Manager commands to v0.7 (sophisticated orchestration)
- Git features to v0.8-0.9 (nice to have, not critical early)
- Beta at v1.0 with log management
Next: Commit this improved roadmap
Notes: Key insight - search makes logs useful, so it must come early. Installation must be solid before scaling. Git features are advanced, not foundational.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:55 - Designed search-optimized log format
Did:
- Added structured patterns: Error: [category] - "message"
- Added solution pattern: Solved: [what] by [how]
- Added tagging system: #error #solution #decision
- Created example showing all patterns in use
Next: Commit roadmap with search optimization
Notes: Key insight - logs need consistent patterns for effective search. Tags enable filtering, structured formats enable extraction. 'Error:' and 'Solved:' become grep-able markers.

---

### 2025-06-29 18:57 - Planned claudepm command accessibility
Did:
- Designed two-part strategy for Claude access to claudepm
- Installation locations: /usr/local/bin (sudo) or ~/.claudepm/bin (no sudo)
- CLAUDE.md templates will include claudepm usage instructions
- Claude will check with 'which claudepm' and use fallback paths
- Updated install.sh to mention future CLI locations
Next: Commit all roadmap improvements
Notes: Key insight - Claude needs explicit instruction on where to find claudepm. Templates must include command examples and fallback paths. This enables 'claudepm search' from any Claude session.

---

### 2025-06-29 19:00 - Added git branching strategy to roadmap
Did:
- Mapped each roadmap version to a feature branch
- Defined workflow: branch → work → PR → tag → next
- Each version gets clear git scope
- PRs will document version changes
- Sets foundation for future automation (auto-branch creation)
Next: Commit this complete roadmap
Notes: This connects roadmap structure directly to git workflow. Eventually 'claudepm feature start v0.2' could read roadmap and create the right branch automatically.

---

### 2025-06-29 19:03 - Updated templates with roadmap best practices
Did:
- Added roadmap principles to CLAUDE_PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md
- Updated PROJECT_ROADMAP_TEMPLATE.md with versioned structure
- Added roadmap guidance to CLAUDE_MANAGER.md
- Emphasized: version features, make actionable, enable automation
- Connected roadmap structure to git branching
Next: Commit all updates
Notes: Teaching Claude to write better roadmaps - structured for search, versioned for branches, clear enough for automation. Roadmaps become executable specs, not just wishlists.

---

### 2025-06-29 19:14 - Added sub-agent report pattern to Manager Claude
Did:
- Added guidance for spawning sub-agents for detailed reports
- Included example prompt for project analysis
- Added daily/weekly review pattern using sub-agents
- Emphasized parallel agent spawning for multiple projects
Next: Commit and close out productive session
Notes: This pattern scales - Manager Claude orchestrates while sub-agents do deep analysis. Each agent gets full context from three-document system. Validates our design worked perfectly\!

---

### 2025-06-29 19:18 - Added dynamic scoping for sub-agent reports  
Did:
- Created specific prompts for standup/daily/weekly with time scopes
- Added grep patterns for filtering logs by date
- Standup: last 3 entries, Daily: today only, Weekly: 7 days
- Included bash examples for efficient date-based filtering
Next: Commit these improvements
Notes: Dynamic scoping prevents information overload - agents only read what's relevant for the report type. Makes reports faster and more focused. Date-based grep patterns leverage our timestamp format.

---

### 2025-06-29 19:22 - Added manager report persistence to roadmap and updated progress
Did:
- PLANNED: Manager report persistence feature in PROJECT_ROADMAP.md v0.7
- PLANNED: Reports will save to ~/.claudepm/reports/ for searchability
- IMPLEMENTED: Dynamic scoping in CLAUDE_MANAGER.md sub-agent patterns
- UPDATED: PROJECT_ROADMAP.md Active Work section with accomplishments
- DOCUMENTED: v0.1 complete with 28 specific items in Completed section
Next: Commit and wrap up productive session
Notes: Manager report persistence creates hierarchical memory - project logs → daily summaries → weekly reports → monthly analysis. Each level aggregates the one below. Makes long-term patterns visible.

---

### 2025-06-29 19:28 - Learned important lesson about PLANNED vs IMPLEMENTED
Did:
- DISCOVERED: Context summary ambiguity led to claiming we implemented a feature we only planned
- DOCUMENTED: Need to distinguish "Added X to roadmap" (planning) vs "Implemented X" (doing)
- IDENTIFIED: Pattern for clearer log entries using PLANNED/IMPLEMENTED/DOCUMENTED prefixes
- REALIZED: This confusion is systematic and should be addressed in templates
Next: Update templates with this guidance to help future Claudes
Notes: User caught this - I was about to commit saying we implemented manager report persistence when we only added it to the roadmap. This distinction is critical for accurate context preservation.

---

### 2025-06-29 19:35 - Tested sub-agent functionality and added structured report formats
Did:
- TESTED: All 5 sub-agent report types (standup, daily, weekly, health, patterns)
- VALIDATED: Dynamic scoping works perfectly - agents only read relevant timeframes
- IMPLEMENTED: Structured report formats in CLAUDE_MANAGER.md for consistency
- ADDED: Multi-project aggregation pattern for executive summaries
- DOCUMENTED: Future report persistence paths (~/.claudepm/reports/)
Next: Commit these improvements and wrap up session
Notes: Sub-agent pattern works excellently! Each report type now has a specific format, making Manager Claude reports more consistent and valuable. The structured formats ensure key information isn't missed.

---

### 2025-06-29 19:50 - Added brain dump processing and lightweight deadline tracking
Did:
- IMPLEMENTED: Brain dump processing pattern in CLAUDE_MANAGER.md
- DESIGNED: Intelligent inbox that routes unstructured updates to projects
- ADDED: Simple [DUE: YYYY-MM-DD] deadline notation to templates
- PLANNED: Brain dump processing feature in PROJECT_ROADMAP.md v0.7
- DOCUMENTED: How Manager Claude extracts deadlines, blockers, and priorities
Next: Commit these additions and close productive session
Notes: This creates a powerful pattern - users can brain dump to Manager Claude, which parses the input and spawns sub-agents to update each affected project's roadmap. Keeps the core simple (just markdown patterns) while enabling sophisticated multi-project updates.

---

### 2025-06-29 19:55 - Clarified what works today vs future CLI features
Did:
- UPDATED: PROJECT_ROADMAP.md to distinguish current capabilities from future CLI
- DOCUMENTED: Brain dump processing works TODAY through Claude's intelligence
- CLARIFIED: Search, deadline scanning, and reports work with grep/bash + Claude
- ADDED: "What Already Works" section highlighting no-CLI-needed features
- REALIZED: The power is in patterns + Claude, not traditional code
Next: Commit this clearer understanding
Notes: Key insight - many "features" don't need code, just clear patterns for Claude to follow. Brain dumps, deadline scanning, and multi-project reports all work through Claude's Task tool and bash commands. Future CLI commands would just add convenience, not core functionality.

---

### 2025-06-29 19:58 - Added /brain-dump slash command for Manager Claude
Did:
- IMPLEMENTED: /brain-dump slash command in CLAUDE_MANAGER.md
- ORGANIZED: All slash commands in one section for discoverability
- LINKED: Brain dump processing section now references the slash command
- MAINTAINED: Both slash command and detailed patterns available
Next: Commit all updates and wrap up session
Notes: The /brain-dump command makes this powerful feature more discoverable. Users can quickly dump updates with `/brain-dump [text]` and Manager Claude will parse and route to appropriate projects.

---

### 2025-06-29 20:05 - Properly implemented slash commands as files
Did:
- CREATED: .claude/commands/ directory with 6 slash command files
- IMPLEMENTED: /brain-dump, /daily-standup, /daily-review, /weekly-review, /project-health, /start-work
- ADDED: Claude Code best practices link as resource in CLAUDE.md
- UPDATED: install.sh to copy slash commands during installation
- DOCUMENTED: Commands use $ARGUMENTS for parameter passing
Next: Commit properly implemented slash commands
Notes: Following Claude Code best practices, slash commands are now actual files in .claude/commands/, not just documentation. Each command has detailed instructions and output formats. This makes them actually usable when typing / in Claude.

---

### 2025-06-29 20:10 - Improved slash command descriptors for better discoverability
Did:
- UPDATED: All 6 slash command files to have clear first-line descriptors
- REMOVED: Markdown headers (#) that might interfere with command palette
- IMPROVED: Each command now starts with concise description of its purpose
- MAINTAINED: Detailed instructions and examples in command bodies
Next: Commit all improvements and push to GitHub
Notes: The first line of each command file now serves as the descriptor that shows when typing / in Claude. This makes commands more discoverable with descriptions like "Process unstructured updates and route to relevant projects".

---

### 2025-06-29 20:12 - Added pre-commit roadmap check guidance
Did:
- IMPLEMENTED: "Before committing" guidance in all templates
- EMPHASIZED: Always update PROJECT_ROADMAP.md before creating commit
- ADDED: Checklist for roadmap updates (completed items, new tasks, status)
- UPDATED: PROJECT_ROADMAP.md timestamp as example of the practice
Next: Commit all improvements and push to GitHub
Notes: This prevents the common issue of commits not reflecting roadmap state. Now Claude will always check: Are completed items moved? New tasks added? Status current? This maintains accurate project state.

---

### 2025-06-29 20:20 - Implemented project adoption functionality
Did:
- IMPLEMENTED: Adoption instructions in CLAUDE_MANAGER.md
- CREATED: /adopt-project slash command with full analysis logic
- DESIGNED: .claudepm marker file specification for tracking
- ADDED: Metadata architecture for managed project discovery
- DOCUMENTED: JSON structure for project metadata
- UPDATED: Templates to mention .claudepm file (gitignored)
Next: Test adoption on a real project
Notes: Adoption works TODAY through Manager Claude! The /adopt-project command analyzes existing projects, imports TODOs, discovers commands, and creates appropriate claudepm files. The .claudepm marker prevents re-initialization and tracks adoption metadata.

---

### 2025-06-29 20:30 - Fixed /adopt-project to use full template content
Did:
- FIXED: /adopt-project now includes complete CLAUDE.md template content
- IMPROVED: Clear instructions to preserve ALL template sections
- ADDED: Proper PROJECT_ROADMAP.md generation with template structure
- ENHANCED: Initial CLAUDE_LOG.md with header and detailed first entry
- DOCUMENTED: Guidance for future log entries in the initial log
Next: Update cv-scraping with proper template content
Notes: The original /adopt-project was creating minimal files. Now it properly uses the full templates while adding discovered project-specific content. This ensures adopted projects get all claudepm principles and guidance.

---

### 2025-06-29 20:35 - Added Kanban module to future roadmap
Did:
- PLANNED: Kanban-style project organization as optional module
- DESIGNED: Simple markdown-based board (Backlog/Ready/In Progress/Review/Done)
- PROPOSED: Integration with existing PROJECT_ROADMAP.md structure
- ENVISIONED: /kanban slash command for visual project state
- MAINTAINED: Keep it simple - just markdown, no complex tooling
Next: Continue testing adoption functionality
Notes: Kanban would be an optional enhancement that builds on the existing roadmap structure. Active Work items naturally map to "In Progress", completed items to "Done". Could auto-move items based on log entries.

---

### 2025-06-29 20:45 - Fleshed out Kanban and Work Item ID system design
Did:
- REFINED: Kanban as a VIEW of PROJECT_ROADMAP.md, not new storage
- DESIGNED: Work Item ID system (TYPE-## format) for full traceability
- PLANNED: IDs flow through roadmap → logs → git commits
- ENVISIONED: Cross-referencing enables "Show me everything about AUTH-01"
- PROPOSED: HTML comments for metadata to keep roadmaps readable
- DETAILED: Worker Claude rules for state transitions
Next: Test existing functionality before implementing new features
Notes: Key insight - PROJECT_ROADMAP.md already IS a kanban board, we just need to surface it differently. The ID system would enable powerful queries like feature timelines, velocity tracking, and cross-project pattern analysis. Keeping this as future enhancement to avoid feature creep.

---

### 2025-06-29 20:50 - Created /orient command for instant context
Did:
- IMPLEMENTED: /orient slash command for quick orientation
- DESIGNED: Different outputs for Manager vs Worker Claude roles
- ADDED: Auto-detection of current location and available files
- INCLUDED: Quick status summary and next actions
- COVERED: Edge case when no claudepm structure exists
Next: Test the orient command in different contexts
Notes: The /orient command solves the "where am I?" problem instantly. It detects if you're at manager level or in a project, reads relevant files, and provides role-specific guidance. Perfect for new Claude sessions or after context switches.

---

### 2025-06-29 20:55 - Added manager-level logging and parallel patterns
Did:
- CREATED: Manager-level CLAUDE_LOG.md in ~/projects
- DOCUMENTED: Manager Claude should maintain its own activity log
- EMPHASIZED: Use parallel Task execution for multi-project analysis
- ADDED: "Projects affected" field to manager log format
- WARNED: Against sequential loading that causes context overload
Next: Test parallel execution patterns with real projects
Notes: Two key insights: (1) Logging should be universal at all levels, including manager level. (2) Manager Claude must use parallel sub-agents to avoid loading entire project histories into one context. This scales much better.

---


### 2025-06-29 21:05 - Updated installer with manager logging
Did:
- ADDED: Manager CLAUDE_LOG.md creation to install.sh
- UPDATED: Slash command suggestions to include all 8 commands
- IMPROVED: First-time setup experience with better guidance
Next: Test the updated installer on a fresh setup
Notes: The installer now creates a complete manager-level environment including the activity log. This ensures users start with proper logging from day one.

---


### 2025-06-29 21:10 - Added parallel work guidance
Did:
- ADDED: Branch name pattern for log entries when not on main
- DOCUMENTED: Simple merge conflict resolution for CLAUDE_LOG.md
- IMPLEMENTED: Merge marker pattern to explain timeline jumps
- UPDATED: Both CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE_PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md
Next: Test with actual parallel branches/worktrees
Notes: This solves the inevitable log conflicts from parallel work. The 'keep both' approach preserves all history while merge markers explain any timeline confusion.

---


### 2025-06-29 21:20 - Implemented template version management
Did:
- IMPLEMENTED: /doctor command to check project health and template versions
- IMPLEMENTED: /update command to refresh project templates
- ADDED: template_version field to .claudepm marker files
- CREATED: TEMPLATE_VERSION file and TEMPLATE_CHANGELOG.md
- UPDATED: Installer to track template versions
Next: Test doctor and update commands on real projects
Notes: This solves template drift - projects can check if they're outdated and update when needed. The update command preserves project-specific content while refreshing the template structure.

---


### 2025-06-29 21:25 - Clarified content preservation in update commands
Did:
- IMPROVED: /update command with explicit bash examples for content extraction
- CLARIFIED: How project-specific sections are preserved during updates
- ENHANCED: /adopt-project to note it preserves existing CLAUDE.md content
- DOCUMENTED: Specific sed commands for extracting custom sections
Next: Test update command on a real project with customizations
Notes: Both commands now clearly show they preserve project-specific content. The update command includes actual bash snippets showing how custom sections are extracted and reinserted.

---


### 2025-06-29 21:30 - Rewrote README.md to clarify architecture
Did:
- REPLACED: Old README with comprehensive architecture explanation
- ADDED: Clear diagram showing manager vs project structure
- DOCUMENTED: Install-once-use-everywhere pattern
- EXPLAINED: How slash commands work at manager level
- INCLUDED: Common workflows and examples
Next: Create LICENSE file and test full installation flow
Notes: The README now clearly explains that claudepm is installed at the projects root and uses slash commands to manage individual projects. This should prevent confusion about the two-level architecture.

---


### 2025-06-30 15:15 - Enhanced manager-level logging guidance
Did:
- ADDED: "When to Log" section emphasizing frequent manager logging
- DOCUMENTED: Log after ANY slash command, routing, or status check
- PROVIDED: Specific examples for /doctor, /brain-dump, and parallel tasks
- ADDED: Logging reminders directly in slash command outputs
- EMPHASIZED: Manager activities are easier to forget than project work
Next: Test logging patterns with real manager operations
Notes: Manager Claude needs more frequent logging than Worker Claude because coordination activities are ephemeral. Added explicit triggers and examples to ensure manager-level context is preserved.

---


### 2025-06-30 16:10 - Enhanced parallel execution patterns and examples
Did:
- EMPHASIZED: Parallel Tasks as the DEFAULT, not exception
- ADDED: Concrete examples showing parallel vs sequential (✅ vs ❌)
- PROVIDED: Speed comparisons (30 seconds parallel vs 5 minutes sequential)
- UPDATED: /doctor, /weekly-review, /brain-dump with explicit parallel patterns
- CREATED: Golden Rule - "If checking more than ONE project, parallelize!"
Next: Monitor if Manager Claude adopts parallel patterns more readily
Notes: The documentation now strongly encourages parallel Task execution with clear examples of GOOD vs BAD patterns. Each major slash command shows exactly how to spawn parallel sub-agents. This should overcome the tendency to process projects sequentially.

---


### 2025-07-01 11:07 - Established MCP integration philosophy
Did:
- DISCUSSED: How to integrate macOS apps (Mail, Calendar, Notes) with claudepm
- INSTALLED: apple-mcp server for primitive macOS app access
- DOCUMENTED: Philosophy that MCP servers provide primitives, not workflows
- ADDED: MCP Integration Philosophy section to PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
Next: Create example slash commands for common integration patterns
Notes: Key insight - orchestration intelligence belongs in Claude, not in MCP tools. Natural language + slash commands provide the workflow layer on top of MCP primitives.

---


### 2025-07-01 11:18 - Implemented safe append-only logging pattern
Did:
- DISCOVERED: I accidentally used Write tool which could have destroyed log history
- RESTORED: Original log from git (no data was lost)
- IMPLEMENTED: Safe append pattern using cat >> with heredoc
- UPDATED: All templates (CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE_PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md, CLAUDE_MANAGER.md)
- ADDED: Critical warnings to never use Write/Edit on CLAUDE_LOG.md
Next: Update PROJECT_ROADMAP.md and test with other projects
Notes: This pattern makes it mechanically impossible to overwrite logs. The >> operator only appends, and heredoc makes multi-line entries clean. This is a perfect example of "make the right thing easy and the wrong thing impossible."

### 2025-07-01 11:24 - Made CLAUDE_LOG.md truly append-only
Did:
- FIXED: Heredoc pattern to use proper multiline append
- UPDATED: All templates with cleaner cat >> pattern  
- APPLIED: macOS chflags uappnd to make file system-level append-only
- TESTED: Write/Edit tools now fail with EPERM error
- VERIFIED: Append with >> still works perfectly
Next: Document this protection in templates and roadmap
Notes: Now it's mechanically impossible to overwrite. The uappnd flag prevents any operation except append. To remove: chflags nouappnd CLAUDE_LOG.md

### 2025-07-01 11:25 - Testing clean multiline append pattern
Did:
- TESTED: Multiline append with heredoc
- VERIFIED: No extra END_OF_LOG output
Next: Update PROJECT_ROADMAP.md with append-only documentation
Notes: This is a test entry to ensure clean output

---


### 2025-07-01 11:27 - Finalized append-only logging system
Did:
- IMPLEMENTED: Clean multiline append pattern using heredoc
- DISCOVERED: System reminders show shell artifacts, not our commands
- TESTED: Multiple variations to find cleanest approach
- DOCUMENTED: Proper pattern in all templates
Next: Re-apply uappnd flag and update PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
Notes: The cat >> with unquoted heredoc is the cleanest pattern. Allows date substitution and multiline content.

---

### 2025-07-01 11:30 - Finalized clean append-only pattern
Did:
- SIMPLIFIED: Using command grouping with braces
- AVOIDED: Heredoc quirks and shell artifacts
- UPDATED: All templates with this cleaner pattern
Next: Re-apply uappnd flag and update PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
Notes: This pattern is simple, readable, and always works correctly

---


### 2025-07-01 11:35 - Systematized append-only protection in claudepm
Did:
- UPDATED: installer.sh to apply chflags uappnd on macOS
- UPDATED: /adopt-project command to apply protection
- DOCUMENTED: Protection in all templates with removal instructions
- BUMPED: Template version to 0.1.2
- ADDED: Changelog entry for this security enhancement
Next: Commit these changes and test installation
Notes: Now every claudepm project gets automatic log protection on macOS. The pattern is simple, the protection is automatic, and the documentation is clear.

---


### 2025-07-01 11:38 - Created development process documentation
Did:
- CREATED: CONTRIBUTING.md with comprehensive feature checklist
- DOCUMENTED: What to update when adding features (code, templates, version, docs)
- ADDED: Development process section to PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
- UPDATED: CLAUDE.md to reference the checklist
- PROVIDED: Example using append-only protection feature
Next: Commit these improvements
Notes: Now we have a systematic process for feature development. This prevents missing steps and ensures consistency across all claudepm components.

### 2025-07-01 11:50 - Clarified CLAUDE.md vs PROJECT_ROADMAP.md separation
Did:
- IDENTIFIED: Overlap caused by dogfooding (using claudepm to develop claudepm)
- CLARIFIED: CLAUDE.md = HOW to act (behavioral), ROADMAP = WHAT/WHY (context)
- MOVED: Project philosophy from CLAUDE.md to PROJECT_ROADMAP.md Notes
- REPLACED: Philosophy with specific commands in CLAUDE.md
- DOCUMENTED: Three-document architecture clearly in roadmap
Next: Continue using this clearer separation
Notes: The overlap was natural but confusing. Now each file has a clear purpose: CLAUDE.md instructs behavior, PROJECT_ROADMAP.md holds context and decisions, CLAUDE_LOG.md records history.

---


### 2025-07-01 11:52 - Meta-articulated the document separation in templates
Did:
- ADDED: HTML comments to both templates explaining HOW vs WHAT/WHY
- STRUCTURED: PROJECT_ROADMAP_TEMPLATE.md Notes section with clear categories
- BUMPED: Template version to 0.1.3
- DOCUMENTED: Changes in TEMPLATE_CHANGELOG.md
Next: Update roadmap and commit all improvements
Notes: The templates now guide users to maintain the same clean separation we discovered through dogfooding. This prevents future confusion about where content belongs.

---


### 2025-07-01 12:03 - Better integrated template versioning (v0.1.4)
Did:
- UPDATED: README.md with comprehensive versioning explanation and current version
- ADDED: Template versioning to core philosophy and design principles
- ENHANCED: /orient command to show template version and outdated warning
- ADDED: Changelog references in template HTML comments
- EXPLAINED: Why versioning matters - evolution without disruption
- BUMPED: Template version to 0.1.4
Next: Commit and push these improvements
Notes: Template versioning is now a first-class concept throughout claudepm, not just an implementation detail. Users understand why it exists and how to use it.

---


### 2025-07-01 12:08 - Added commit reminders to encourage timely commits
Did:
- ADDED: 'Commit completed work' as core principle #6
- UPDATED: Feature checklist with explicit 'COMMIT NOW' step
- APPLIED: Same changes to project template
Next: Commit these changes immediately (practicing what we preach\!)
Notes: I failed to commit after completing v0.1.4 work. This improvement makes committing more prominent in the workflow to prevent that oversight.
