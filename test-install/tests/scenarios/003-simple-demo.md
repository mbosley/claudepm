# Test Scenario 003: Simple Demo

## Objective
Demonstrate the testing framework with simple operations that will definitely work.

## Test Steps

1. **Create Test Directory**
   - Create `/tmp/test-demo-[timestamp]`
   - Verify it exists

2. **File Operations**

   - Should fail gracefully

## Expected Results
- All basic operations succeed
- Error handling works correctly
- No system errors

## Report Format
- PASS/FAIL for each step
- Include command outputs
- Total execution time
