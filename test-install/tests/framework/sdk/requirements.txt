# Requirements for AI behavioral testing
# Note: Claude Code SDK installation requires npm, not pip
# This file is for any Python testing utilities we need

# For now, we'll use subprocess to call the Claude Code CLI
# Future additions might include:
# - pytest for test organization
# - python-dotenv for environment variables
# - requests for API interactions
