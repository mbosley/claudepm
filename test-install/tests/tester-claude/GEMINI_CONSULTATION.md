# Gemini Consultation: Tester Claude Pattern

## Context
We're developing claudepm v0.2.5, a simple memory system for Claude Code sessions. We've just implemented the core infrastructure and discovered several bash compatibility issues through manual sandbox testing. Now we want to formalize a "Tester Claude" pattern that acts like a human QA tester.

## Our Testing Discovery
We created a sandbox and manually tested claudepm's init functionality. This revealed:
1. mapfile command not available in macOS bash 3.2
2. JSON parsing issues with nested structures
3. grep count output including whitespace
4. IFS parsing problems with task lists

These were all fixed, but the process showed the value of having Claude act as a human tester who:
- Creates sandboxes
- Runs commands as a user would
- Reports what they observe
- Finds edge cases through exploration

## The Tester Claude Concept

Similar to how we have Task Agent Claude for feature development, we want Tester Claude for QA:

**Project Lead Claude** (on dev branch) spawns:
â†’ **Tester Claude** (in test sandbox) who:
  - Gets a test scenario/mission
  - Creates a fresh environment
  - Tests like a human would
  - Reports findings back

## Key Questions for Gemini

### 1. Pattern Design
How should we structure the Tester Claude pattern? We're thinking:
- TESTER_PROMPT.md files that define test scenarios
- Sandboxes for isolated testing
- Reports that capture both success and failure paths
- Focus on exploratory testing vs scripted testing

### 2. Claude CLI vs GUI Capabilities
We need to understand the differences between:
- `claude -p "prompt"` (CLI with -p flag)
- Claude Code GUI (interactive session)

Specifically:
- Can CLI mode use multiple tools in sequence?
- Can CLI mode maintain state across tool uses?
- What are the limitations of CLI mode for complex testing scenarios?
- Should Tester Claude be spawned via CLI or require GUI interaction?

### 3. Integration with Existing Testing
We already have:
- Traditional bats tests for deterministic behavior
- AI behavioral tests using Claude SDK
- The Tester Claude would add human-like exploratory testing

How do we best integrate these three approaches?

### 4. Practical Implementation
Given our bash-based v0.2.5 architecture, how should we:
- Structure test scenarios (markdown files?)
- Capture and validate results
- Make tests repeatable enough to be useful
- Balance thoroughness with API costs

### 5. Scaling Considerations
As claudepm grows:
- How do we prevent Tester Claude sessions from becoming too expensive?
- Should we limit Tester Claude to release testing?
- Can we create "test fixtures" that Tester Claude reuses?
- How do we version test scenarios with the code?

## Our Current Thinking

We imagine something like:
```bash
# Project Lead spawns Tester Claude
claude -p "You are Tester Claude. Your mission: Test the claudepm init command
in various scenarios. Start by reading tests/tester-claude/scenarios/init-command.md
for your test plan. Create a sandbox in tests/tester-claude/sandboxes/init-test-001/
and report findings to tests/tester-claude/reports/init-test-001.md"
```

But we're unsure if this would work effectively with CLI mode limitations.

## Request for Gemini

Please provide architectural guidance on:
1. The Tester Claude pattern design
2. CLI vs GUI capabilities and limitations
3. Best practices for human-like AI testing
4. Integration with our existing test approaches
5. Any concerns or improvements you see

Remember our core philosophy: Keep it simple, solve real problems, don't over-engineer.
