# v0.2.5.1 Implementation Plan: Claude-First Design

## Vision
Transform claudepm from "a CLI that creates files for Claude" into "Claude's native project memory interface."

## Core Problems with v0.2.5
1. Templates teach Claude to manually manipulate files (grep, sed, append)
2. Claude learns complex bash patterns instead of simple commands
3. Unclear whether human or Claude is the primary user
4. Commands output human-friendly text, not Claude-parseable
5. Missing Claude-specific workflow commands

## Key Changes

### 1. New Claude-Centric Commands

#### `claudepm status` - Complete session context
```bash
$ claudepm status
Project: my-app (v0.2.5)
Health: ðŸŸ¢ Active (last work: 2 hours ago)
Git: 3 uncommitted files
Tasks: 2 TODO, 1 IN_PROGRESS, 1 BLOCKED
Next: "Implement password reset flow" (from last log)
```

#### `claudepm log <message>` - Replace bash heredocs
```bash
$ claudepm log "Implemented user authentication with JWT"
# Automatically adds timestamp, formats properly, appends to LOG.md
# Can add --next "task description" flag
```

#### `claudepm context` - Session startup info
```bash
$ claudepm context
# Shows: last 3 log entries, active tasks, git status, next items
# Everything Claude needs to start working
```

#### `claudepm next` - What to work on
```bash
$ claudepm next
Suggested tasks:
1. [IN_PROGRESS] Fix memory leak (started yesterday)
2. [TODO] Implement password reset (high priority)
3. [BLOCKED] Payment integration - waiting for API keys
```

#### `claudepm find-blocked` - Manager level
```bash
$ claudepm find-blocked ~/projects/*
Blocked tasks across all projects:
- auth-app: Waiting for Stripe keys (2 days)
- blog: Need design mockups (5 days)
- ml-project: GPU access required (1 day)
```

### 2. Template Rewrites

#### Project CLAUDE.md - Complete Rewrite
```markdown
## Start Every Session
```bash
claudepm context  # Get oriented - shows last work, active tasks, git status
```

## During Work

When you discover a new task:
```bash
claudepm task add "Fix authentication bug"
```

When you complete a task:
```bash
claudepm task done <uuid>
```

When blocked:
```bash
claudepm task block <uuid> "waiting for API keys"
```

## After Each Work Block
```bash
claudepm log "Implemented JWT authentication"
# Or with next task:
claudepm log "Fixed auth bug" --next "Add refresh token support"
```

## Quick Commands
- `claudepm status` - Full project state
- `claudepm task list` - All tasks
- `claudepm next` - What to work on
```

#### Manager CLAUDE.md - Use Commands Not Bash
```markdown
## Start Manager Session
```bash
claudepm doctor  # Check all registered projects
```

## Find Issues
```bash
claudepm find-blocked      # All blocked tasks
claudepm find-stale --days 7  # Projects with no activity
```

## For Parallel Analysis
Still use Task tool, but with claudepm:
```python
Task: "Check auth-app", prompt: "cd auth-app && claudepm status"
Task: "Check blog", prompt: "cd blog && claudepm status"
```
```

### 3. Command Output Changes

#### Make Output Claude-Parseable
```bash
# Current (human-focused):
$ claudepm health
Project: my-app
âœ“ Templates: v0.2.5 (current)
âš  Git status: Uncommitted changes

# New (Claude-focused):
$ claudepm health
PROJECT_NAME: my-app
TEMPLATE_VERSION: 0.2.5 (current)
GIT_STATUS: uncommitted_changes (3 files)
LAST_ACTIVITY: 2024-01-07 14:30
BLOCKED_TASKS: 1
ACTIVE_TASKS: 3
HEALTH: yellow (uncommitted changes, 1 blocker)
```

#### Add --json Flag
```bash
$ claudepm status --json
{
  "project": "my-app",
  "version": "0.2.5",
  "git": {
    "status": "uncommitted",
    "files": 3
  },
  "tasks": {
    "todo": 2,
    "in_progress": 1,
    "blocked": 1
  }
}
```

### 4. Behavioral Changes

#### Auto-discovery
- `claudepm init` should detect if in git repo and set up .gitignore
- `claudepm adopt` should be smarter about finding test commands
- `claudepm doctor` should auto-scan from current directory if no args

#### Better Integration
- Commands should reference each other ("Run `claudepm next` to see priorities")
- Error messages should suggest fixes ("No tasks found. Use `claudepm task add`")
- Success messages should guide next steps

### 5. Implementation Order

1. **Add new commands** (status, context, log, next)
2. **Update templates** to be claudepm-command-centric
3. **Improve output formatting** for Claude parsing
4. **Add --json flags** for structured output
5. **Update existing commands** with Claude-friendly output
6. **Test with real Claude sessions**
7. **Update documentation**

## Success Criteria

Claude should be able to:
1. Start a session with just `claudepm context`
2. Never need to manually grep/sed/awk files
3. Complete all workflows using claudepm commands
4. Get structured data when needed (--json)
5. Understand project state from command output

## Migration Path

Since this is a patch release (0.2.5.1):
- All existing commands continue to work
- New commands are additions, not replacements
- Templates are updated but files remain compatible
- Projects on 0.2.5 work without changes

## Key Principle

Every command should answer: "What would Claude naturally want to do here?"

Not: "What bash commands can we wrap?"

This makes claudepm feel like a natural extension of Claude's capabilities.
