# Project Roadmap - claudepm

*Last updated: 2025-07-02*

## Current Status
v0.2.0 released! ðŸŽ‰ Available at https://github.com/mbosley/claudepm

A minimal memory system for Claude Code using three markdown files. Version 0.2.0 introduces a two-file architecture that separates generic instructions from user customizations, enabling deterministic updates without AI intervention. The system includes CLAUDE.md (customizations), CLAUDEPM-*.md (managed core), CLAUDE_LOG.md (append-only history), and PROJECT_ROADMAP.md (living state document).

  - `/weekly-review` - Week summary, completed items, next week priorities
  - `/project-health` - Which projects need attention?
  - `/start-work [project]` - Quick briefing before diving into project
  - `/brain-dump` - Process unstructured updates and route to projects
  - `/email-check` - Process emails as project updates via apple-mcp
- [ ] Sub-agent report generation pattern
  - Manager spawns one agent per project for deep analysis
  - Each agent reads three documents + git history
  - Reports synthesized for cross-project insights
  - Dynamic scoping: daily = today only, weekly = 7 days, etc.
  - Efficient log filtering with grep by date patterns
- [ ] **Brain Dump Processing** (Intelligent Inbox)
  - ALREADY WORKS: Manager Claude can manually process brain dumps using documented patterns
  - ALREADY WORKS: Sub-agent spawning via Task tool to update roadmaps
  - FUTURE: CLI command `claudepm inbox "update text"` for convenience
  - FUTURE: Automated report saving after processing
  - FUTURE: Batch processing of multiple updates
  - NOTE: Core functionality works today through Claude's intelligence, not code
- [ ] **Email Ingestion via apple-mcp** (Project Updates from Email)
  - ALREADY WORKS: MCP servers provide email reading capability
  - NEW: /email-check command processes emails as project updates
  - Filters emails for project-relevant content
  - Suggests (never auto-updates) changes to PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
  - Extracts deadlines, decisions, and blockers
  - Manager mode: Routes email updates to appropriate projects
  - Project mode: Filters for project-specific emails only
  - Philosophy: Email is a read-only source; humans approve all changes
- [ ] **Manager Report Persistence** (Hierarchical Memory)
  - Save daily summaries to `~/.claudepm/reports/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
  - Save weekly summaries to `~/.claudepm/reports/weekly/`

### Testing Strategy (Needs Design)
- [ ] **Script Testing** (Traditional)
  - Installer creates correct directories
  - Handles existing files properly
  - Works on bash/zsh/fish
  - Error handling for missing dependencies
- [ ] **Template Testing** (Semi-automated)
  - Markdown linting for syntax
  - Required sections present
  - Example entries are valid
  - Timestamp formats correct
- [ ] **Behavioral Testing** (The Hard Part)
  - Mock Claude sessions to test instruction following
  - Create test scenarios: "You haven't seen this project in 2 weeks"
  - Measure: How long to restore context?
  - Test: Does Claude actually append to logs?
  - Test: Does Claude avoid creating new files?
- [ ] **System Testing**
  - Create sandbox with 5-10 mock projects
  - Test manager-level scanning
  - Test status detection (active/stale/blocked)
  - Performance with many projects
- [ ] **Dogfooding**
  - claudepm must manage its own development
  - Every PR must show logs/roadmap updates
  - Real usage is the best test

### Future Ideas (Post-Beta)
- [ ] VS Code extension
- [ ] GitHub Actions integration
- [ ] Project templates by type
- [ ] Export formats
- [ ] **Kanban Module** (Optional Enhancement)
  - Visual project state using markdown-based boards
  - Core insight: PROJECT_ROADMAP.md already IS a kanban board (Upcoming=Backlog, Active=In Progress)
  - Kanban as a VIEW of existing data, not new storage
  - `/kanban` command renders roadmap as board
  - `/kanban-all` shows cross-project board
  
- [ ] **Work Item ID System** (Enables Kanban & Traceability)
  - Structured IDs: [TYPE-##] (FEAT-01, BUG-15, TASK-03)
  - Metadata in HTML comments: <!--- ID: AUTH-01 | STARTED: 2025-06-29 -->
  - IDs flow through roadmap â†’ logs â†’ git commits
  - Enables full traceability: "Show me everything about AUTH-01"
  - Worker Claude rules for state transitions
  - Cross-referencing pattern:
    - Roadmap: <!--- ID: AUTH-01 | STARTED: date -->
    - Logs: "Working on: AUTH-01 - Description"
    - Commits: "feat(AUTH-01): Add JWT token generation"
  - Powerful queries: timeline per feature, velocity tracking, bottleneck detection
  - Manager Claude can show cross-project patterns (e.g., all AUTH work across projects)

## Notes

### Core Philosophy
- **Start dead simple** - Just markdown files, no complex tooling
- **One feature at a time** - Add only after real need proven  
- **Test on ourselves** - claudepm manages claudepm development
- **Resist complexity** - Every addition must justify itself
- **Keep it small** - Core system under 200 lines total
- **Evolution without disruption** - Template versioning lets us improve without breaking existing projects

### Three-Document Architecture
- **CLAUDE.md** = HOW (behavioral instructions for Claude)
- **CLAUDE_LOG.md** = WHAT HAPPENED (append-only history)
- **PROJECT_ROADMAP.md** = WHAT & WHY (state, plans, decisions)

This separation keeps each file focused:
- Instructions don't mix with history
- Plans don't mix with behavioral rules
- Context and rationale have a clear home

### Design Principles
- Everything is just markdown - no complex tools needed
- Files are the product - every feature should improve the markdown files
- Features should emerge from real usage patterns, not speculation
- Git workflow features are aspirational - focus on core memory system first

### Template Versioning Design
Template versioning (via VERSION and CHANGELOG.md) solves a fundamental tension:
- We discover better patterns through dogfooding
- But existing projects shouldn't break when we improve templates
- Solution: Track versions, document changes, preserve customizations

This enables continuous improvement while respecting project stability. Users can review what's new and decide if/when to update, rather than being forced to choose between staying current or staying stable.

### What Already Works (No CLI Needed)
- **Slash commands**: /brain-dump, /daily-standup, /daily-review, /weekly-review, /project-health, /start-work, /adopt-project, /orient, /doctor, /update
- **Brain dump processing**: Manager Claude follows documented patterns to parse and route updates
- **Project adoption**: Manager Claude can analyze and adopt existing projects
- **Quick orientation**: /orient instantly tells Claude their role and context
- **Deadline scanning**: Simple bash loops + grep find all [DUE:] dates
- **Sub-agent reports**: Claude's Task tool spawns focused agents for each project
- **Log searching**: grep commands work for finding patterns
- **Multi-project status**: Bash loops show overview across all projects

The power is in Claude's intelligence + simple markdown patterns, not complex tooling!

### .claudepm Marker File Specification

Each claudepm-managed project contains a `.claudepm` file (gitignored) that tracks:

```json
{
  "claudepm": {
    "version": "0.1",              // claudepm version that created this
    "template_version": "0.1.1",   // template version in use
    "initialized": "2025-06-29T20:30:00Z",
    "last_template_update": "2025-06-29T20:30:00Z"
  },
  "project": {
    "adopted": true,               // false if created new, true if adopted
    "type": "node-web-api",        // discovered project type
    "language": "javascript",      // primary language
    "discovered_commands": {
      "test": "npm test",
      "build": "npm run build",
      "run": "npm start"
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "imported_todos": 5,           // if adopted
    "has_roadmap": true,           // found existing roadmap
    "last_activity_check": "2025-06-29T20:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

This enables:
- Quick identification of managed projects
- Version tracking for updates
- Adoption history and discovered features
- Future migration support

### Git Branching Strategy for Roadmap

Each version becomes a feature branch:
```
main
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/v0.2-perfect-experience
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/v0.3-basic-search  
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/v0.4-installation
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/v0.5-cross-project
â””â”€â”€ feature/v0.6-advanced-search
```

Workflow:
1. `git checkout -b feature/v0.2-perfect-experience`
2. Work on all v0.2 features
3. PR back to main when complete
4. Tag release: `git tag v0.2`
5. Start next: `git checkout -b feature/v0.3-basic-search`

Benefits:
- Clear scope per branch
- Can work on multiple versions in parallel
- Easy to track progress
- PRs document each version's changes
- Roadmap items map directly to git history

### Future Vision: Roadmap as Automation Driver
The PROJECT_ROADMAP.md isn't just documentation - it's structured context for future automation:
- Brain dumps get encoded into actionable features
- Future Claude instances can read roadmap to understand scope
- Enables "work on these features" commands to spawn focused agents
- Markdown format is both human and machine readable
- Rich context preservation enables intelligent task distribution

### How Claude Accesses claudepm Commands

Two-part strategy for Claude integration:

1. **Installation puts claudepm in standard location**:
   ```bash
   # Primary: /usr/local/bin/claudepm (requires sudo)
   # Fallback: ~/.claudepm/bin/claudepm (no sudo needed)
   # Last resort: ~/projects/.claudepm/bin/claudepm
   ```

2. **CLAUDE.md teaches Claude to use it**:
   ```markdown
   ## Using claudepm
   Check if available: `which claudepm || echo "Using fallback"`
   Fallback: `~/.claudepm/bin/claudepm [command]`
   
   Common commands:
   - `claudepm search "error message"` - Search logs
   - `claudepm status` - Check all projects
   - `claudepm log` - Add log entry
   ```

This ensures Claude can always find and use claudepm commands via Bash tool.

### Why Log Search is Critical
Log search transforms claudepm from a memory system to a knowledge system:
- "Have I seen this error before?" â†’ Find past solutions instantly
- "How did I implement auth last time?" â†’ Reuse successful patterns
- Accumulated knowledge across all projects becomes searchable
- Claude can search before attempting solutions, avoiding repeated mistakes
- The more you use claudepm, the smarter it gets

### Search-Optimized Log Format Ideas
Example of searchable log entry:
```
### 2025-06-29 18:50 - Fixed authentication bug #error #solution
Did: 
- Error: [Auth] - "TypeError: Cannot read property 'user' of undefined"
- Debugged: User object not initialized in session
- Solved: Initialize empty user object in middleware by adding `req.session.user = req.session.user || {}`
- Tested: Login flow now works correctly
Next: Add proper TypeScript types for session
Tags: #authentication #session #middleware #typescript
```

Key patterns for search:
- Error: [category] - "exact error message"
- Solved: [problem] by [solution]
- Decided: [choice] because [reasoning]
- Command: `exact command used`
- Tags: #category #technology #concept

### MCP Integration Philosophy
MCP servers should provide primitives, not workflows:
- **MCP servers** (apple-mcp, llm-tools) = Low-level tool access
- **Natural language** = Orchestrate tools to update claudepm files
- **Slash commands** = Shortcut common integration patterns

Example: Don't build "ingest_email_to_log()" in MCP. Instead:
1. MCP provides "read_email()" primitive
2. Claude orchestrates: read â†’ extract â†’ format â†’ update CLAUDE_LOG.md
3. Slash command `/ingest-email` makes it convenient

This keeps MCP servers focused and claudepm workflows flexible. The intelligence lives in Claude's orchestration, not in the tools.

### Development Process
When adding features to claudepm, follow the checklist in CLAUDE.md:
1. Update code/scripts (install.sh, slash commands)
2. Update all affected templates
3. Bump VERSION and update CHANGELOG.md
4. Update documentation (README, roadmap)
5. Test thoroughly (fresh install, adoption, updates)
6. Log the work and update roadmap before committing

This ensures consistency and prevents missing components. The full checklist lives in CLAUDE.md under "When asked to add a feature" - keeping our three-document principle intact.

claudepm now follows an 'architect-first' development model for non-trivial changes. Before writing code, we use the /architect-feature command to generate comprehensive implementation plans. This approach ensures changes are well-considered, aligned with project principles, and have a clear path to completion. The architect-first approach was validated during the v0.1.5 template reorganization and is now standard practice.
