- [ ] Log compression for old entries
- [ ] Interactive setup wizard
- [ ] Migration tool for existing projects
- [ ] Full documentation
- [ ] Example workflows

### Testing Strategy (Needs Design)
- [ ] **Script Testing** (Traditional)
  - Installer creates correct directories
  - Handles existing files properly
  - Works on bash/zsh/fish
  - Error handling for missing dependencies
- [ ] **Template Testing** (Semi-automated)
  - Markdown linting for syntax
  - Required sections present
  - Example entries are valid
  - Timestamp formats correct
- [ ] **Behavioral Testing** (The Hard Part)
  - Mock Claude sessions to test instruction following
  - Create test scenarios: "You haven't seen this project in 2 weeks"
  - Measure: How long to restore context?
  - Test: Does Claude actually append to logs?
  - Test: Does Claude avoid creating new files?
- [ ] **System Testing**
  - Create sandbox with 5-10 mock projects
  - Test manager-level scanning
  - Test status detection (active/stale/blocked)
  - Performance with many projects
- [ ] **Dogfooding**
  - claudepm must manage its own development
  - Every PR must show logs/roadmap updates
  - Real usage is the best test

### Future Ideas (Post-Beta)
- [ ] VS Code extension
- [ ] GitHub Actions integration
- [ ] Project templates by type
- [ ] Export formats
- [ ] **Kanban Module** (Optional Enhancement)
  - Visual project state using markdown-based boards
  - Core insight: PROJECT_ROADMAP.md already IS a kanban board (Upcoming=Backlog, Active=In Progress)
  - Kanban as a VIEW of existing data, not new storage
  - `/kanban` command renders roadmap as board
  - `/kanban-all` shows cross-project board
  
- [ ] **Work Item ID System** (Enables Kanban & Traceability)
  - Structured IDs: [TYPE-##] (FEAT-01, BUG-15, TASK-03)
  - Metadata in HTML comments: <!--- ID: AUTH-01 | STARTED: 2025-06-29 -->
  - IDs flow through roadmap â†’ logs â†’ git commits
  - Enables full traceability: "Show me everything about AUTH-01"
  - Worker Claude rules for state transitions
  - Cross-referencing pattern:
    - Roadmap: <!--- ID: AUTH-01 | STARTED: date -->
    - Logs: "Working on: AUTH-01 - Description"
    - Commits: "feat(AUTH-01): Add JWT token generation"
  - Powerful queries: timeline per feature, velocity tracking, bottleneck detection
  - Manager Claude can show cross-project patterns (e.g., all AUTH work across projects)

## Blocked
None currently

## Notes
- Keep it under 200 lines total
- Resist adding features until proven necessary
- The three-document system (instructions, history, roadmap) provides past/present/process
- Everything is just markdown - no tools, no complexity
- Git workflow features (v0.4) are aspirational - focus on core memory system first
- Features should emerge from real usage patterns, not speculation

### What Already Works (No CLI Needed)
- **Slash commands**: /brain-dump, /daily-standup, /daily-review, /weekly-review, /project-health, /start-work, /adopt-project, /orient, /doctor, /update
- **Brain dump processing**: Manager Claude follows documented patterns to parse and route updates
- **Project adoption**: Manager Claude can analyze and adopt existing projects
- **Quick orientation**: /orient instantly tells Claude their role and context
- **Deadline scanning**: Simple bash loops + grep find all [DUE:] dates
- **Sub-agent reports**: Claude's Task tool spawns focused agents for each project
- **Log searching**: grep commands work for finding patterns
- **Multi-project status**: Bash loops show overview across all projects

The power is in Claude's intelligence + simple markdown patterns, not complex tooling!

### .claudepm Marker File Specification

Each claudepm-managed project contains a `.claudepm` file (gitignored) that tracks:

```json
{
  "claudepm": {
    "version": "0.1",              // claudepm version that created this
    "template_version": "0.1.1",   // template version in use
    "initialized": "2025-06-29T20:30:00Z",
    "last_template_update": "2025-06-29T20:30:00Z"
  },
  "project": {
    "adopted": true,               // false if created new, true if adopted
    "type": "node-web-api",        // discovered project type
    "language": "javascript",      // primary language
    "discovered_commands": {
      "test": "npm test",
      "build": "npm run build",
      "run": "npm start"
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "imported_todos": 5,           // if adopted
    "has_roadmap": true,           // found existing roadmap
    "last_activity_check": "2025-06-29T20:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

This enables:
- Quick identification of managed projects
- Version tracking for updates
- Adoption history and discovered features
- Future migration support

### Git Branching Strategy for Roadmap

Each version becomes a feature branch:
```
main
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/v0.2-perfect-experience
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/v0.3-basic-search  
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/v0.4-installation
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/v0.5-cross-project
â””â”€â”€ feature/v0.6-advanced-search
```

Workflow:
1. `git checkout -b feature/v0.2-perfect-experience`
2. Work on all v0.2 features
3. PR back to main when complete
4. Tag release: `git tag v0.2`
5. Start next: `git checkout -b feature/v0.3-basic-search`

Benefits:
- Clear scope per branch
- Can work on multiple versions in parallel
- Easy to track progress
- PRs document each version's changes
- Roadmap items map directly to git history

### Future Vision: Roadmap as Automation Driver
The PROJECT_ROADMAP.md isn't just documentation - it's structured context for future automation:
- Brain dumps get encoded into actionable features
- Future Claude instances can read roadmap to understand scope
- Enables "work on these features" commands to spawn focused agents
- Markdown format is both human and machine readable
- Rich context preservation enables intelligent task distribution

### How Claude Accesses claudepm Commands

Two-part strategy for Claude integration:

1. **Installation puts claudepm in standard location**:
   ```bash
   # Primary: /usr/local/bin/claudepm (requires sudo)
   # Fallback: ~/.claudepm/bin/claudepm (no sudo needed)
   # Last resort: ~/projects/.claudepm/bin/claudepm
   ```

2. **CLAUDE.md teaches Claude to use it**:
   ```markdown
   ## Using claudepm
   Check if available: `which claudepm || echo "Using fallback"`
   Fallback: `~/.claudepm/bin/claudepm [command]`
   
   Common commands:
   - `claudepm search "error message"` - Search logs
   - `claudepm status` - Check all projects
   - `claudepm log` - Add log entry
   ```

This ensures Claude can always find and use claudepm commands via Bash tool.

### Why Log Search is Critical
Log search transforms claudepm from a memory system to a knowledge system:
- "Have I seen this error before?" â†’ Find past solutions instantly
- "How did I implement auth last time?" â†’ Reuse successful patterns
- Accumulated knowledge across all projects becomes searchable
- Claude can search before attempting solutions, avoiding repeated mistakes
- The more you use claudepm, the smarter it gets

### Search-Optimized Log Format Ideas
Example of searchable log entry:
```
### 2025-06-29 18:50 - Fixed authentication bug #error #solution
Did: 
- Error: [Auth] - "TypeError: Cannot read property 'user' of undefined"
- Debugged: User object not initialized in session
- Solved: Initialize empty user object in middleware by adding `req.session.user = req.session.user || {}`
- Tested: Login flow now works correctly
Next: Add proper TypeScript types for session
Tags: #authentication #session #middleware #typescript
```

Key patterns for search:
- Error: [category] - "exact error message"
- Solved: [problem] by [solution]
- Decided: [choice] because [reasoning]
- Command: `exact command used`
- Tags: #category #technology #concept
