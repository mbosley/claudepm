### v0.5 - Cross-Project Basics
- [ ] Create claudepm CLI tool with commands:
  - `claudepm init` - Initialize new project with all 3 files
  - `claudepm status` - Show all projects status
  - `claudepm list` - List all projects with claudepm
- [ ] Automatic project discovery
- [ ] Basic multi-project status view

### v0.6 - Advanced Search & Intelligence
- [ ] **Cross-project search** 
  - Search all projects for similar problems
  - "How did I solve auth in other projects?"
  - Learn from past implementations
- [ ] **Smart search features**
  - Search by type: errors, blockers, solutions
  - Search by date range
  - Search in specific sections (Did/Next/Blocked)
- [ ] **Search from Claude**
  - Claude can search logs before attempting solutions
  - Reduces repeating past mistakes
  - Builds on accumulated knowledge

### v0.7 - Manager Intelligence & Commands
- [ ] Advanced status commands:
  - `claudepm recap` - Weekly/daily summaries
  - `claudepm health` - Project health check
- [ ] Stale project detection
- [ ] Manager Claude slash commands
  - `/daily-standup` - What's on deck today across all projects?
  - `/daily-review` - What got done today? What's blocked?

  - `/project-health` - Which projects need attention?
  - `/start-work [project]` - Quick briefing before diving into project
- [ ] Sub-agent report generation pattern
  - Manager spawns one agent per project for deep analysis
  - Each agent reads three documents + git history
  - Reports synthesized for cross-project insights
  - Dynamic scoping: daily = today only, weekly = 7 days, etc.
  - Efficient log filtering with grep by date patterns
- [ ] **Manager Report Persistence** (Hierarchical Memory)
  - Save daily summaries to `~/.claudepm/reports/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
  - Save weekly summaries to `~/.claudepm/reports/weekly/`
  - Monthly reports can aggregate daily summaries
  - Makes manager insights searchable over time
  - Enables trend analysis: "What were common blockers last month?"

### v0.8 - Git Integration

- [ ] Show uncommitted changes in status
- [ ] Branch awareness in logs
- [ ] Commit message templates using recent logs

### v0.9 - Git Workflow Support
- [ ] Automatic feature branch creation
  - `claudepm feature start [name]` creates branch and logs it
  - Updates PROJECT_ROADMAP.md to track feature branch
- [ ] Pull request integration
  - `claudepm feature pr` creates PR with summary from logs
  - Links PR to roadmap item
- [ ] Branch-aware logging
  - Logs show which branch work was done on
  - Automatic log entry when switching branches
- [ ] Review workflow

- [ ] Maximum log size handling
- [ ] Log entry templates
- [ ] Log compression for old entries
- [ ] Interactive setup wizard
- [ ] Migration tool for existing projects
- [ ] Full documentation
- [ ] Example workflows

### Testing Strategy (Needs Design)
- [ ] **Script Testing** (Traditional)
  - Installer creates correct directories
  - Handles existing files properly
  - Works on bash/zsh/fish
  - Error handling for missing dependencies
- [ ] **Template Testing** (Semi-automated)
  - Markdown linting for syntax
  - Required sections present
  - Example entries are valid
  - Timestamp formats correct
- [ ] **Behavioral Testing** (The Hard Part)
  - Mock Claude sessions to test instruction following
  - Create test scenarios: "You haven't seen this project in 2 weeks"
  - Measure: How long to restore context?
  - Test: Does Claude actually append to logs?
  - Test: Does Claude avoid creating new files?
- [ ] **System Testing**
  - Create sandbox with 5-10 mock projects
  - Test manager-level scanning
  - Test status detection (active/stale/blocked)
  - Performance with many projects
- [ ] **Dogfooding**
  - claudepm must manage its own development
  - Every PR must show logs/roadmap updates
  - Real usage is the best test

### Future Ideas (Post-Beta)
- [ ] VS Code extension
- [ ] GitHub Actions integration
- [ ] Project templates by type
- [ ] Export formats

## Blocked
None currently

## Notes
- Keep it under 200 lines total
- Resist adding features until proven necessary
- The three-document system (instructions, history, roadmap) provides past/present/process
- Everything is just markdown - no tools, no complexity
- Git workflow features (v0.4) are aspirational - focus on core memory system first
- Features should emerge from real usage patterns, not speculation

### Git Branching Strategy for Roadmap

Each version becomes a feature branch:
```
main
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/v0.2-perfect-experience
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/v0.3-basic-search  
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/v0.4-installation
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/v0.5-cross-project
â””â”€â”€ feature/v0.6-advanced-search
```

Workflow:
1. `git checkout -b feature/v0.2-perfect-experience`
2. Work on all v0.2 features
3. PR back to main when complete
4. Tag release: `git tag v0.2`
5. Start next: `git checkout -b feature/v0.3-basic-search`

Benefits:
- Clear scope per branch
- Can work on multiple versions in parallel
- Easy to track progress
- PRs document each version's changes
- Roadmap items map directly to git history

### Future Vision: Roadmap as Automation Driver
The PROJECT_ROADMAP.md isn't just documentation - it's structured context for future automation:
- Brain dumps get encoded into actionable features
- Future Claude instances can read roadmap to understand scope
- Enables "work on these features" commands to spawn focused agents
- Markdown format is both human and machine readable
- Rich context preservation enables intelligent task distribution

### How Claude Accesses claudepm Commands

Two-part strategy for Claude integration:

1. **Installation puts claudepm in standard location**:
   ```bash
   # Primary: /usr/local/bin/claudepm (requires sudo)
   # Fallback: ~/.claudepm/bin/claudepm (no sudo needed)
   # Last resort: ~/projects/.claudepm/bin/claudepm
   ```

2. **CLAUDE.md teaches Claude to use it**:
   ```markdown
   ## Using claudepm
   Check if available: `which claudepm || echo "Using fallback"`
   Fallback: `~/.claudepm/bin/claudepm [command]`
   
   Common commands:
   - `claudepm search "error message"` - Search logs
   - `claudepm status` - Check all projects
   - `claudepm log` - Add log entry
   ```

This ensures Claude can always find and use claudepm commands via Bash tool.

### Why Log Search is Critical
Log search transforms claudepm from a memory system to a knowledge system:
- "Have I seen this error before?" â†’ Find past solutions instantly
- "How did I implement auth last time?" â†’ Reuse successful patterns
- Accumulated knowledge across all projects becomes searchable
- Claude can search before attempting solutions, avoiding repeated mistakes
- The more you use claudepm, the smarter it gets

### Search-Optimized Log Format Ideas
Example of searchable log entry:
```
### 2025-06-29 18:50 - Fixed authentication bug #error #solution
Did: 
- Error: [Auth] - "TypeError: Cannot read property 'user' of undefined"
- Debugged: User object not initialized in session
- Solved: Initialize empty user object in middleware by adding `req.session.user = req.session.user || {}`
- Tested: Login flow now works correctly
Next: Add proper TypeScript types for session
Tags: #authentication #session #middleware #typescript
```

Key patterns for search:
- Error: [category] - "exact error message"
- Solved: [problem] by [solution]
- Decided: [choice] because [reasoning]
- Command: `exact command used`
- Tags: #category #technology #concept
