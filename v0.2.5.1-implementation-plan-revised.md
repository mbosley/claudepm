# v0.2.5.1 Implementation Plan (Revised): Claude Behavioral Standard

## Core Purpose of claudepm

1. **Shared behavioral standard** - CLAUDE.md teaches consistent behavior across all projects
2. **Context documents** - ROADMAP.md, LOG.md, NOTES.md provide persistent memory
3. **Structured interface** - claudepm CLI gives Claude reliable commands to interact with these documents

## The Key Insight

claudepm isn't about replacing Claude's ability to read/write files. It's about providing:
- **Consistent commands** that work the same way in every project
- **Structured operations** on the context documents
- **Behavioral guardrails** that ensure Claude follows best practices

## What This Means for v0.2.5.1

### 1. Focus on Teaching Behavior, Not Just Commands

The templates should teach Claude:
- WHEN to use claudepm commands
- WHY to use them instead of direct file manipulation
- HOW they maintain consistency across projects

### 2. Commands as Behavioral Enforcement

Each command enforces good practices:

#### `claudepm log` - Enforces proper logging
```bash
# Instead of Claude deciding how to format logs
# claudepm ensures consistent structure
claudepm log "Implemented auth" --next "Add tests"
# Always creates proper timestamp, format, structure
```

#### `claudepm task add` - Enforces task tracking
```bash
# Instead of Claude maybe forgetting to track tasks
# claudepm makes it natural
claudepm task add "Fix memory leak"
# Always creates UUID, timestamp, proper format
```

#### `claudepm context` - Enforces session startup
```bash
# Instead of Claude maybe reading different files
# claudepm provides consistent context
claudepm context
# Always shows: recent logs, active tasks, git status
```

### 3. Template Updates Should Emphasize "Why"

#### Project CLAUDE.md
```markdown
## Core Behavior: Use claudepm for ALL Project Memory

Why: claudepm ensures consistent behavior across all projects. When you use these commands, you're following the same patterns whether in a Python CLI, Node.js app, or Rust library.

## Start Every Session
```bash
claudepm context
```
This ensures you ALWAYS:
- See recent work from LOG.md
- Check active tasks from ROADMAP.md  
- Understand git status
- Get the same context format in every project

## When You Discover Work
```bash
claudepm task add "Description"
```
This ensures you ALWAYS:
- Track work in ROADMAP.md
- Use consistent CPM::TASK format
- Generate proper UUIDs
- Maintain task history

## After Work Blocks
```bash
claudepm log "What you did" --next "What's next"
```
This ensures you ALWAYS:
- Update LOG.md with proper format
- Include timestamp automatically
- Maintain append-only history
- Leave clear next steps
```

### 4. Commands Should Feel Natural to Claude

Instead of "utility commands", they should map to Claude's natural workflow:

- `claudepm context` → "I need to understand where we are"
- `claudepm task add` → "I discovered something that needs doing"
- `claudepm task done` → "I completed this work"
- `claudepm log` → "I should record what I did"
- `claudepm next` → "What should I work on?"

### 5. Implementation Priorities

1. **Update templates FIRST** - Teach the behavioral standard
2. **Add natural workflow commands** - context, log, next
3. **Improve existing commands** - Make output Claude-friendly
4. **Keep it simple** - Don't over-engineer, focus on core behaviors

## Success Metrics

Claude should:
1. **Always use claudepm commands** for project memory operations
2. **Never manually append** to LOG.md or ROADMAP.md
3. **Follow consistent behavior** across all project types
4. **Feel like claudepm is natural**, not imposed

## The Standard We're Setting

Every Claude session in a claudepm project should:
1. Start with `claudepm context`
2. Track discoveries with `claudepm task add`
3. Update progress with `claudepm task done/block`
4. End with `claudepm log`

This creates predictable, consistent Claude behavior across all projects.
