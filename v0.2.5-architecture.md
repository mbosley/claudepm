# claudepm v0.2.5 Architecture Document

## Executive Summary

claudepm v0.2.5 is a "Simple Centralization" release that solves the version drift problem without introducing complexity. Following the principle of "do one thing well," this version adds centralized template management while maintaining the dead-simple markdown-based workflow that makes claudepm effective.

**Core Philosophy**: Solve today's problem with tomorrow's simplicity in mind.

### Version
- Document Version: 1.0
- Target claudepm Version: 0.2.5
- Date: 2025-01-03
- Status: Proposed Architecture

### What This Version Does
1. **Centralizes templates** to eliminate version drift
2. **Adds simple conventions** for better tooling
3. **Provides basic utilities** without new dependencies
4. **Maintains backward compatibility** with existing projects
5. **Adds NOTES.md** for project wisdom and context

### What This Version Explicitly Does NOT Do
- No database or indexing
- No Python dependencies
- No complex parsing
- No structured XML/JSON blocks
- No breaking changes to existing files
- No "management overhead"

## Problems Solved

### 1. Version Drift (Primary Goal)
**Current Pain**: Projects using different template versions leads to:
- Inconsistent behavior across projects
- Forgotten improvements in old projects
- Manual copying of enhancements

**v0.2.5 Solution**: Single source of truth in `~/.claudepm/templates/`

### 2. Difficult Updates
**Current Pain**: Updating templates means visiting every project

**v0.2.5 Solution**: `claudepm update-templates` command

### 3. No Health Visibility
**Current Pain**: Can't easily see which projects need attention

**v0.2.5 Solution**: Simple `claudepm doctor` and `claudepm health` commands

## Core Documents (What Goes Where)

### The Four Essential Files

1. **CLAUDE.md** - How to work
   - Project-specific instructions and workflows
   - Available commands (test, build, deploy)
   - Team conventions and patterns
   - "How do I...?" answers

2. **LOG.md** - What happened (append-only)
   - Chronological work history
   - Session-by-session progress
   - Decisions made in the moment
   - Blockers encountered and resolved

3. **ROADMAP.md** - What's next
   - Current tasks (TODO, IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED, DONE)
   - Version milestones (v0.1, v0.2, etc.)
   - Deadlines and priorities
   - Feature specifications

4. **NOTES.md** - What we learned
   - Architecture decisions and rationale
   - Discovered patterns and gotchas
   - API quirks and workarounds
   - Performance insights
   - "Why did we...?" answers
   - Accumulated project wisdom

### Simple Rule: Where Should This Go?
- **Instructions for working** → CLAUDE.md
- **What I just did** → LOG.md (append)
- **What needs doing** → ROADMAP.md
- **What I discovered** → NOTES.md

## Conventions (Not Parsing)

Following Gemini's advice, we establish structured conventions that are both human-readable and grep-friendly.

### Task Format
```
CPM::TASK::[UUID]::[STATUS]::[DATE]::Description
CPM::TASK::7f3b4e5d::TODO::2025-01-10::Implement search functionality
CPM::TASK::8a4c6f7e::DONE::2025-01-03::Fix authentication bug
CPM::TASK::9b5d7g8f::BLOCKED::2025-01-03::Cache implementation (Blocked: waiting for API keys)
CPM::TASK::1a2b3c4d::IN_PROGRESS::2025-01-03::Refactor authentication module
```

**Why this format?**
- Double colons (`::`) are rare in normal text
- Fixed positions enable simple `cut` commands
- UUIDs enable future cross-references (use `date +%s%N` if no uuidgen)
- Still readable in plain markdown
- Blocked reasons go in description for simplicity

**Standard Statuses** (documented in CONVENTIONS.md):
- `TODO` - Not started
- `IN_PROGRESS` - Currently working on
- `BLOCKED` - Waiting on something (specify in description)
- `DONE` - Completed

### Log Entry Format (Existing)
```markdown
### 2025-01-03 14:30 - Brief summary
Did: What was accomplished
Next: Immediate next task
Blocked: Optional blocker description
Notes: Optional additional context

---
```

### Note Format (Optional Structure)
```markdown
## Architecture Decision: Database Choice
Date: 2025-01-03
Tags: database, architecture

We chose PostgreSQL over MySQL because...

## Discovery: Rate Limiting Pattern
Date: 2025-01-05
Tags: api, performance

Found that the API requires...

## Gotcha: Test Database Cleanup
Date: 2025-01-07
Tags: testing, database

Always remember to...
```

Notes are free-form but benefit from consistent headings and dates for searchability.

### Benefits
- `grep "CPM::TASK"` finds all tasks
- `grep "CPM::TASK::.*::BLOCKED"` finds blocked tasks
- `cut -d'::' -f4` extracts specific fields
- No regex needed for basic operations

## Core Tools

### claudepm Command
A simple bash script installed at `~/.claudepm/bin/claudepm`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# claudepm - Simple project memory management
set -euo pipefail  # Safety first!

CLAUDEPM_HOME="${CLAUDEPM_HOME:-$HOME/.claudepm}"
CLAUDEPM_CONFIG="${CLAUDEPM_CONFIG:-$HOME/.config/claudepm}"
CLAUDEPM_VERSION=$(cat "$CLAUDEPM_HOME/VERSION")

# Source utility functions
source "$CLAUDEPM_HOME/lib/utils.sh"

case "$1" in
    init)
        # Initialize new project/manager
        # Checks user templates first, then defaults
        ;;
    adopt)
        # Adopt existing project
        # Adds to projects.list for fast doctor command
        ;;
    upgrade)
        # Upgrade project to latest version (non-destructive)
        # Only updates .claudepm version marker
        ;;
    doctor)
        # Check all projects health
        # Uses projects.list or accepts path arguments
        ;;
    health)
        # Check current project health
        ;;
    task)
        # Simple task operations
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Usage: claudepm {init|adopt|upgrade|doctor|health|task}"
        ;;
esac
```

### Key Commands

#### claudepm init [type]
```bash
# Create new project with templates
claudepm init project
claudepm init manager
```

#### claudepm adopt
```bash
# Analyze existing project and create claudepm files
cd existing-project
claudepm adopt
# Creates: CLAUDE.md, LOG.md, ROADMAP.md, NOTES.md, .claudepm
```

#### claudepm upgrade
```bash
# Upgrade project to latest version (non-destructive)
claudepm upgrade
# Updates: .claudepm version marker
# Adds: Any new standard files from templates
# Never overwrites: Existing files with user content
# Shows diff: If core instructions have important updates
```

#### claudepm doctor
```bash
# System-wide health check
$ claudepm doctor
# Uses projects.list for speed, or:
$ claudepm doctor ~/projects ~/work

#### claudepm task
```bash
# Simple task operations
claudepm task add "Implement search"
# Adds: CPM::TASK::$(uuidgen)::TODO::$(date +%Y-%m-%d)::Implement search

claudepm task list
# Shows all tasks with nice formatting

claudepm task list --blocked
# Shows only blocked tasks
```

### Enhanced get-context.sh

Stays simple but adds basic filtering:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# get-context.sh - Assemble context for Claude

# Default behavior (enhanced)
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    cat CLAUDE.md
    echo -e "\n## Recent Logs\n"
    tail -n 50 LOG.md
    echo -e "\n## Current Roadmap\n"
    cat ROADMAP.md
    echo -e "\n## Project Notes (Recent)\n"
    # Show last 500 lines of notes (about 2-3 decisions/discoveries)
    tail -n 500 NOTES.md
    exit 0
fi

# New filtering options
case "$1" in
    --days)
        # Only logs from last N days
        ;;
    --blocked)
        # Include blocked items prominently
        ;;
    --standup)
        # Morning standup format
        ;;
    --weekly)
        # Weekly review format
        ;;
esac
```

## Simple Utilities

### Finding Blocked Items
```bash
# In ~/.claudepm/lib/utils.sh
find_blocked() {
    echo "=== Blocked Tasks ==="
    grep "CPM::TASK::.*::BLOCKED" ROADMAP.md | \
        cut -d'::' -f6- | \
        sed 's/^/  - /'
    
    echo -e "\n=== Blocked in Logs ==="
    grep -A2 "^Blocked:" LOG.md | tail -20
}
```

### UUID Generation
```bash
# Simple UUID generation with maximum portability
generate_uuid() {
    if command -v uuidgen >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        uuidgen | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
    else
        # Fallback: timestamp with nanoseconds (unique enough)
        date +%s%N
    fi
}
```

### Safe Template Operations
```bash
# Copy template only if destination doesn't exist
safe_copy_template() {
    local template="$1"
    local destination="$2"
    
    if [[ -f "$destination" ]]; then
        echo "File exists: $destination (skipping)"
        return 0
    fi
    
    # Check user templates first
    if [[ -f "$CLAUDEPM_CONFIG/templates/$template" ]]; then
        cp "$CLAUDEPM_CONFIG/templates/$template" "$destination"
        echo "Created: $destination (from user template)"
    elif [[ -f "$CLAUDEPM_HOME/templates/$template" ]]; then
        cp "$CLAUDEPM_HOME/templates/$template" "$destination"
        echo "Created: $destination"
    else
        echo "Error: Template not found: $template" >&2
        return 1
    fi
}
```

## Version Management

### The .claudepm File
Simple key-value format (not JSON):
```
template_version=0.2.5
adopted_date=2025-01-03
last_update_check=2025-01-03
```

### Version Checking
```bash
check_version() {
    local project_version=$(grep "template_version" .claudepm | cut -d'=' -f2)
    local current_version=$(cat ~/.claudepm/VERSION)
    
    if [ "$project_version" != "$current_version" ]; then
        echo "Templates outdated: $project_version → $current_version"
        echo "Run: claudepm update-templates"
        return 1
    fi
    return 0
}
```

## Migration Guide

### For Existing v0.2.0 Projects

1. **Install claudepm v0.2.5**
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/[...]/claudepm
cd claudepm
./install.sh  # Creates ~/.claudepm/
```

2. **Upgrade existing projects**
```bash
cd ~/projects/my-app
claudepm adopt      # Detects v0.2.0, preserves customizations
claudepm upgrade    # Updates version marker, adds missing files
```

3. **Register with doctor (optional)**
```bash
# Automatic registration
echo "$PWD" >> ~/.claudepm/projects.list

# Or let adopt do it
claudepm adopt  # Also adds to projects.list
```

4. **Commit the changes**
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: Migrate to claudepm v0.2.5

- Adopted centralized template system
- Updated to latest version
- Added .claudepm version marker"
```

### What Gets Preserved

During `upgrade`, everything between customization markers is preserved:
```markdown
<!-- CLAUDEPM_CUSTOMIZATION_START -->
[Your custom content remains untouched]
<!-- CLAUDEPM_CUSTOMIZATION_END -->
```

### Initial NOTES.md Content

For new projects, NOTES.md starts with:
```markdown
# Project Notes

## Overview
[Brief description of what this project does and why it exists]

## Key Decisions

## Discovered Patterns

## Gotchas & Workarounds

## Performance Notes

## External Resources
```

For adopted projects, claudepm can extract:
- Comments marked with NOTE:, IMPORTANT:, or TODO:
- Sections from existing documentation
- Patterns discovered during adoption analysis

## Task Agent Workflow Integration

### Overview
While v0.2.5 focuses on core infrastructure, it's designed to support the three-level Claude hierarchy. Here's how Project Lead Claude creates and manages Task Agents:

### Project Lead Workflow for Feature Development

#### 1. Feature Planning
Project Lead adds feature to ROADMAP.md:
```bash
# Add feature with UUID
echo "CPM::TASK::$(generate_uuid)::TODO::$(date +%Y-%m-%d)::Implement user authentication" >> ROADMAP.md
```

#### 2. Create Worktree (Manual in v0.2.5)
```bash
# Project Lead stays on dev branch
git worktree add worktrees/add-auth feature/add-auth
cd worktrees/add-auth

# Create task prompt
cat > TASK_PROMPT.md << 'EOF'
# Task Agent Mission: Implement User Authentication

You are a Task Agent working in worktrees/add-auth/

## Your Mission
Implement JWT-based user authentication

## Requirements
- Create login/logout endpoints
- Add authentication middleware
- Secure existing routes
- Add tests

## Constraints
- Use existing database schema
- Follow project conventions (see ../../CLAUDE.md)
- Create atomic commits
- Update documentation

## Process
1. Read ../../LOG.md for project context
2. Read ../../NOTES.md for patterns
3. Implement features
4. Test thoroughly
5. Create PR back to dev
6. Stop after PR creation

Remember: You work in isolation. The Project Lead will review and merge.
EOF
```

#### 3. Dispatch Task Agent
Project Lead starts a NEW Claude conversation:
```markdown
You are a Task Agent for [project-name]. 

Start by running:
cd ~/projects/my-app/worktrees/add-auth

Then read TASK_PROMPT.md for your mission.
```

#### 4. Task Agent Execution
Task Agent works independently:
```bash
# In the worktree
cd ~/projects/my-app/worktrees/add-auth

# Read context
cat TASK_PROMPT.md
cat ../../LOG.md | tail -100  # Recent project history
cat ../../NOTES.md            # Project patterns

# Work and log
{
echo ""
echo "### $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M') - [feature/add-auth] - Started authentication implementation"
echo "Did: Set up JWT token generation"
echo "Next: Create middleware"
echo ""
} >> ../../LOG.md

# Make commits
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: Add JWT token generation

- Created auth service with JWT support
- Added token generation endpoint
- Includes refresh token logic"

# Continue work...

# Create PR when done
gh pr create --base dev \
  --title "feat: Add user authentication" \
  --body "## Summary
  
  Implemented JWT-based authentication as specified.
  
  ## Changes
  - Added login/logout endpoints
  - Created auth middleware
  - Secured all routes
  - Added comprehensive tests
  
  ## Testing
  - All tests pass
  - Manual testing completed
  - No breaking changes
  
  Implements: CPM::TASK::[uuid-from-roadmap]"
```

#### 5. Project Lead Review
Back in main project directory:
```bash
# Project Lead reviews PR
gh pr view 123
gh pr checks 123

# If approved, merge
gh pr merge 123 --squash --delete-branch

# Clean up worktree
git worktree remove worktrees/add-auth

# Update ROADMAP.md
# Change task status from TODO to DONE
sed -i 's/::TODO::.*::Implement user authentication/::DONE::2025-01-04::Implement user authentication/' ROADMAP.md

# Log completion
{
echo ""
echo "### $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M') - Merged user authentication feature"
echo "Did: Reviewed and merged PR #123 from Task Agent"
echo "Next: Deploy to staging"
echo ""
} >> LOG.md
```

### Key Principles

1. **Isolation**: Task Agents work in worktrees, can't affect main code
2. **Clear Missions**: TASK_PROMPT.md defines exact scope
3. **Shared Memory**: Task Agents read (but don't edit) main LOG.md/NOTES.md
4. **Atomic PRs**: One feature, one PR, one merge
5. **Project Lead Control**: Only Project Lead merges and deploys

### Future Automation (Beyond v0.2.5)

In future versions, claudepm could provide:
```bash
# Automated worktree creation with template
claudepm task create "add-auth" "Implement user authentication"

# Task status tracking
claudepm task status

# Automated cleanup after merge
claudepm task complete add-auth
```

But in v0.2.5, we keep it simple - just the file conventions that enable the workflow.

## Slash Commands and Claude Code Integration

### claudepm Slash Commands

claudepm provides its own slash commands that understand the claudepm context:

```
~/.claudepm/commands/
├── brain-dump.md      # Routes updates to projects
├── doctor.md          # Checks project health
├── weekly-review.md   # Aggregates week's work
├── daily-standup.md   # Morning status check
└── start-work.md      # Switch project context
```

#### Why Commands Live in claudepm

1. **Versioned Together**: Commands update when claudepm updates
2. **Context Aware**: They understand CPM::TASK format, four-file structure
3. **No Orphaned Commands**: Uninstalling claudepm removes its commands
4. **Clear Ownership**: These are claudepm features, not generic Claude features
5. **Documentation**: Each command explains claudepm-specific behavior

These commands are claudepm-aware and know how to:
- Parse the CPM::TASK format
- Understand the four-file structure  
- Work with the three-level hierarchy
- Call claudepm tools appropriately
- Route information to the right files

### Installation with Claude Code

To use claudepm slash commands in Claude:

```bash
# Option 1: Symlink (recommended)
ln -s ~/.claudepm/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/

# Option 2: Copy (if symlinks don't work)
cp ~/.claudepm/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/

# Option 3: Manual installation
# Add to CLAUDE.md which slash commands are available
```

### Example: /brain-dump Command

The `~/.claudepm/commands/brain-dump.md` file:
```markdown
---
title: Brain Dump
command: brain-dump
description: Process unstructured updates and route to projects
---

Process this brain dump and route items to appropriate projects:

{{input}}

For each item:
1. Identify which project it relates to (check */ directories)
2. Extract any deadlines (format as [DUE: YYYY-MM-DD])
3. Identify blockers (move to Blocked section)
4. Update the appropriate ROADMAP.md
5. Show me what was updated

Use the CPM::TASK format for new items.
```

This command understands claudepm's structure and conventions, making it much more useful than a generic command.

### Using claudepm Without Claude Code

claudepm is fully functional without slash commands. You can:
```bash
# Use the CLI directly
claudepm doctor
claudepm task add "New feature"

# Or use with Claude via prompt
claude -p "Process this brain dump using claudepm conventions: [your update]"
```

Slash commands are a convenience, not a requirement.

## How Behavioral Instructions Flow

The magic of claudepm is how the same tools produce different behaviors:

1. **Claude reads context** → `get-context.sh` assembles it
2. **Context includes** → User files (CLAUDE.md) + Core instructions (CLAUDEPM-*.md)
3. **Role detection** → Based on directory location and .claudepm contents
4. **Behavior adapts** → Manager vs Project vs Task Agent

Example:
```bash
# At ~/projects/ (Manager level)
get-context.sh
# Returns: CLAUDE.md + CLAUDEPM-MANAGER.md + cross-project view

# At ~/projects/my-app/ (Project level)  
get-context.sh
# Returns: CLAUDE.md + CLAUDEPM-PROJECT.md + project-specific context

# At ~/projects/my-app/worktrees/feature/ (Task Agent)
get-context.sh
# Returns: TASK_PROMPT.md + limited project context
```

## Common Workflows

### Morning Start
```bash
cd ~/projects/my-app
claudepm health          # Quick status check
get-context.sh --standup # What's on for today
# Start working...
```

### After Debugging Session
```bash
# Add discovery to NOTES.md
cat >> NOTES.md << 'EOF'

## Gotcha: Redis Connection Pooling
Date: 2025-01-04
Tags: performance, redis

The Redis client creates a new connection for each request unless you explicitly configure connection pooling. This caused 10x slowdown in production.

Solution:
```javascript
const redis = new Redis({
  maxRetriesPerRequest: 3,
  enableReadyCheck: true,
  lazyConnect: true  // Critical!
});
```
EOF

# Log the session
{
echo ""
echo "### $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M') - Fixed Redis performance issue"
echo "Did: Discovered connection pooling issue, added pooling config"
echo "Next: Monitor production metrics"
echo ""
} >> LOG.md
```

### Feature Planning
```bash
# Add to ROADMAP.md with proper format
UUID=$(generate_uuid)
echo "CPM::TASK::$UUID::TODO::$(date +%Y-%m-%d)::Add user authentication" >> ROADMAP.md
echo "CPM::TASK::$UUID::TODO::$(date +%Y-%m-%d)::Add password reset flow" >> ROADMAP.md
```

## What 'claudepm adopt' Actually Does

For an existing project, adopt is smart:

1. **Analyzes** the project:
   - Reads package.json, Cargo.toml, requirements.txt
   - Scans README for project description
   - Greps for TODO/FIXME comments
   - Checks git history for patterns

2. **Creates** missing files (never overwrites):
   - CLAUDE.md with discovered commands
   - LOG.md with adoption entry
   - ROADMAP.md with imported TODOs
   - NOTES.md with extracted important comments

3. **Preserves** existing content:
   - If LOG.md exists, appends adoption entry
   - If NOTES.md exists, adds new sections
   - Never destroys user data

4. **Registers** the project:
   ```bash
   echo "$PWD" >> ~/.claudepm/projects.list
   ```

Example adoption:
```bash
$ cd ~/projects/legacy-app
$ claudepm adopt

Analyzing project...
✓ Detected: Node.js application
✓ Found: 7 TODO comments
✓ Discovered commands: npm test, npm run build
✓ Extracted: 3 important notes

Creating claudepm files...
✓ Created: CLAUDE.md (with npm commands)
✓ Created: LOG.md (with adoption entry)
✓ Created: ROADMAP.md (imported 7 TODOs)
✓ Created: NOTES.md (extracted documentation)
✓ Created: .claudepm (version 0.2.5)

Project adopted! Run 'claudepm health' to verify.

## Template Customization

Your customizations go between special markers:

```markdown
# Project: My App

[claudepm standard instructions...]

<!-- CLAUDEPM_CUSTOMIZATION_START -->
## Project Specific Setup
1. Install PostgreSQL locally
2. Run: npm run db:setup
3. Copy .env.example to .env

## Our Conventions
- Always use TypeScript strict mode
- Test files next to source files
- Component files start with capital letter
<!-- CLAUDEPM_CUSTOMIZATION_END -->

[more claudepm standard content...]
```

During `claudepm upgrade`:
- Everything between markers is preserved exactly
- Everything outside is updated to latest templates
- Merge conflicts are impossible

## Log Management Over Time

What happens when LOG.md gets huge?

### Natural Log Rotation
When LOG.md exceeds 10MB (about 6 months of heavy use):
```bash
# Archive old logs
mv LOG.md LOG-2024.md

# Start fresh with reference
cat > LOG.md << 'EOF'
### 2025-01-01 00:00 - Rotated logs
Previous logs archived to LOG-2024.md
Contains history from project start through 2024-12-31

---
EOF

# Update .gitignore
echo "LOG-20*.md" >> .gitignore
```

This is a human decision, not automated. Old logs remain searchable but out of active context.

## Git Integration

All four core files should be:
- ✅ Tracked in git
- ✅ Shared with team  
- ✅ Merged carefully

Only `.claudepm` is local (in .gitignore).

### Merge Strategies

For **LOG.md conflicts**:
```bash
# Always keep both sides
git checkout --theirs LOG.md
cat LOG.md.backup >> LOG.md  # Append your changes
git add LOG.md
```

For **ROADMAP.md conflicts**:
- Manual merge to preserve task states
- Check for duplicate UUIDs

For **NOTES.md conflicts**:
- Keep both versions of discoveries
- Consolidate similar patterns

## Installation Details

The install.sh script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

echo "Installing claudepm v0.2.5..."

# 1. Create directory structure
mkdir -p ~/.claudepm/{bin,templates,lib,commands}
mkdir -p ~/.config/claudepm/templates  # For user overrides

# 2. Copy files
cp -r templates/* ~/.claudepm/templates/
cp -r commands/* ~/.claudepm/commands/
cp bin/claudepm ~/.claudepm/bin/
cp lib/utils.sh ~/.claudepm/lib/
chmod +x ~/.claudepm/bin/claudepm

# 3. Add to PATH (if not present)
if ! grep -q "claudepm/bin" ~/.bashrc; then
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.claudepm/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo "Added claudepm to PATH"
fi

# 4. Create initial files
echo "0.2.5" > ~/.claudepm/VERSION
touch ~/.claudepm/projects.list

# 5. Optional: Link slash commands for Claude Code
if [[ -d "$HOME/.claude/commands" ]]; then
    echo "Detected Claude Code installation"
    echo "Link claudepm commands? (y/n)"
    read -r response
    if [[ "$response" == "y" ]]; then
        ln -sf ~/.claudepm/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
        echo "✓ Linked claudepm slash commands"
    fi
fi

echo "✓ Installation complete!"
echo "Run: source ~/.bashrc"
echo "Then: claudepm init project"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found: claudepm
```bash
# Add to PATH manually
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.claudepm/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Version mismatch warnings
```bash
cd ~/projects/my-app
claudepm upgrade  # Non-destructive update
```

### Corrupted task format
```bash
# Find malformed tasks
grep -n "CPM::TASK" ROADMAP.md | grep -v "::[A-Z_]*::"

# Show line numbers for manual fix
nl ROADMAP.md | grep "CPM::TASK"
```

### Projects not showing in doctor
```bash
# Add manually
echo "$PWD" >> ~/.claudepm/projects.list

# Or re-adopt
claudepm adopt
```

## External Tool Integration

claudepm provides the foundation, other tools build on it:

- **Claude Code MCP**: Reads files via get-context.sh
- **Slash Commands**: Call claudepm tools directly
- **git hooks**: Could check `claudepm health` pre-commit
- **CI/CD**: Could verify `claudepm doctor` output
- **VS Code**: Could parse CPM::TASK format for TODO tree

Example git hook (.git/hooks/pre-commit):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
if ! claudepm health | grep -q "✓"; then
    echo "⚠️  Project health check failed"
    echo "Run: claudepm health"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Required .gitignore Entries

Add to your project's .gitignore:
```
# claudepm local metadata
.claudepm

# Optional: archived logs
LOG-20*.md

# Task agent worktrees
worktrees/

# Never ignore the core four!
# CLAUDE.md
# LOG.md  
# ROADMAP.md
# NOTES.md
```

## Future Evolution

### Pain-Driven Development
Create `~/.claudepm/WISHLIST.md` to track friction:
```markdown
### 2025-01-15 - Slow searches
Grep taking 5+ seconds on large LOG.md files
Consider: Simple index file? Limit log size?

### 2025-01-20 - Task relationships  
Need to link "waiting on X" to task X
Consider: Use those UUIDs we're generating?
```

### Potential Next Steps (Based on Real Pain)
1. **Single Python script** for complex queries (not full architecture)
2. **Log rotation** if files get too large
3. **Simple task relationships** using UUIDs
4. **Basic templating** for common tasks

### What We'll Never Add
- Complex XML/JSON in markdown files
- Required database dependencies
- Breaking changes to core workflow
- "Enterprise" features that complicate simple use

## Validation Checklist

Before release, ensure v0.2.5:

- [ ] Solves version drift with minimal complexity
- [ ] Works with existing projects without breaking changes
- [ ] Requires zero new dependencies
- [ ] Can be fully understood by reading this document
- [ ] Maintains the "I could rewrite this in an afternoon" property
- [ ] Makes the easy things easy and the hard things possible
- [ ] **Idempotency**: Can run `init`/`adopt` multiple times safely
- [ ] **Portability**: Scripts work on both Linux and macOS
- [ ] **User Experience**: New user can start in <5 minutes
- [ ] **Testability**: Has basic test suite to prevent regressions

## Design Principles

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
Every feature must pass the "Is this the simplest thing that could possibly work?" test.

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
Don't build for hypothetical future needs. Build for today's actual pain.

### Backward Compatibility
Existing projects should work without modification. New features are opt-in.

### Progressive Enhancement
Start with markdown files. Layer tools on top. Everything should work without the tools.

### Pain-Driven Development
Document friction. Let real pain drive new features, not architectural ambition.

### The Four-File Foundation
Every project has exactly four essential files:
- **CLAUDE.md** - How to work
- **LOG.md** - What happened
- **ROADMAP.md** - What's next  
- **NOTES.md** - What we learned

Everything else is code or truly necessary documentation.

## Conclusion

v0.2.5 represents the "Goldilocks" release - not too simple (doesn't solve problems), not too complex (introduces new ones), but just right. It maintains claudepm's core identity while solving the immediate pain of version drift.

By establishing conventions without enforcement, providing tools without requirements, and centralizing templates without breaking existing projects, we create a foundation for organic growth based on real-world usage.

Remember: The behavioral instructions (three-level hierarchy) remain the heart of claudepm. This technical layer exists only to serve that workflow, not to complicate it.
